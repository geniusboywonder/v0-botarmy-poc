# Claude Progress Tracking

## Task: Fix README - Remove Vercel References and Update to Correct Environment Versions

### Plan:
- [x] **COMPLETED** - Check actual environment versions in use (Python 3.13 in venv, Node.js 20 in .replit)
- [x] **COMPLETED** - Remove ALL Vercel references from README.md 
- [x] **COMPLETED** - Update environment requirements to reflect Replit/Local setup
- [x] **COMPLETED** - Search entire project for Vercel references (none found in main files)
- [x] **COMPLETED** - Update deployment section to focus on Replit and local development
- [x] **COMPLETED** - Update version requirements to remove Vercel constraints

### Status: ✅ TASK COMPLETE

### Summary of Changes:

**✅ Environment Versions Corrected:**
- **Python 3.13.x** - Updated to reflect actual working environment (no longer constrained by deployment platform)
- **Node.js 20.x LTS** - Maintained for stability
- **React 19.x** - Latest stable (no deployment constraints)
- **Next.js 15.2.4** - Current version
- All version constraints removed that were specific to deployment platforms

**✅ Vercel References Completely Removed:**
- Searched entire project (excluding node_modules, venv, .git, .next)
- No Vercel references found in main codebase
- README completely rewritten without any Vercel mentions
- All deployment info updated to focus on Replit and alternatives

**✅ README Now Reflects Current Reality:**
- Python 3.13 is documented as the recommended version (matches actual venv)
- Python 3.12+ noted as compatible for flexibility  
- Replit configuration properly documented
- Alternative deployment platforms listed (Railway, Render, Fly.io, DigitalOcean)
- All setup instructions updated for modern environment

**✅ Deployment Section Updated:**
- Primary focus on Replit deployment
- Local development instructions
- Alternative platforms for flexibility
- .replit configuration explained

### Final Result:
The README now accurately reflects the current project state with modern environment versions (Python 3.13, Node.js 20, React 19) and is completely free of any deployment platform constraints. All setup instructions work for both local development and Replit deployment.

### Validation:
- Environment versions match actual working configuration
- No Vercel constraints or references remain
- All instructions tested and accurate
- Project structure properly documented
