## 🎯 Current Priority Tasks for Jules

### **Focus Area**: Complete the core agent workflow to make it production-ready

The system has excellent foundations but needs the core agent orchestration completed. Jules should focus on making the full workflow robust and reliable.

## 🚀 Next Steps Summary

**Jules should complete these in order:**

1. **Make the full agent workflow work reliably** (HIGH)
2. **Improve agent status display in UI** (HIGH)
3. **Add error recovery mechanisms** (MEDIUM)
4. **Test the complete system end-to-end** (HIGH)
5. **Polish for production readiness** (LOW)

## 📝 Detailed Notes

### **What's Working Well:**
- WebSocket communication is solid and reliable
- Test mode provides excellent development experience
- UI foundation is clean and responsive
- Backend infrastructure is well-architected

### ⚠️ Blockers
- **Environment Issue:** There is a persistent `ImportError` when starting the backend server that is preventing verification of Task 1. The error seems to be caused by an environment inconsistency that I have been unable to resolve. All coding for Task 1 is complete, but it cannot be tested.
- **Frontend Tests:** The frontend integration tests specified in Task 6 were not created. The project's `package.json` does not include any testing libraries (like Jest or React Testing Library), which are required to write these tests.

### **What Needs Completion:**
- Full agent workflow orchestration (5 agents working sequentially) - **Implemented, pending verification.**
- Complete end-to-end testing

### **What's Ready for Production:**
- WebSocket service with auto-reconnect
- Basic UI components and layout
- Environment configuration system
- Test mode for safe development

## 🔍 Architecture Decisions Made

### **WebSocket Protocol**:
- Clean message types with proper routing
- Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff
- Session management with global_session for MVP

### **Agent Test Mode**:
- Role confirmations instead of full LLM processing
- Configurable via AGENT_TEST_MODE environment variable
- Saves tokens during development and testing

### **Frontend State Management**:
- Zustand stores for agent and log state
- Real-time updates via WebSocket message handling
- Clean separation between UI and data logic

## 🎯 Success Criteria

**MVP is complete when:**
- [ ] User can start a project and see all 5 agents respond in sequence
- [ ] Agent status updates appear in real-time in the UI
- [ ] Errors are handled gracefully without crashing
- [ ] Test mode and full mode both work correctly
- [ ] System is robust enough for demonstration purposes
- [ ] All core functionality works reliably

**Production Readiness achieved when:**
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling covers edge cases
- [ ] Agent failures don't crash the entire workflow
- [ ] UI provides clear feedback for all system states
- [ ] Testing validates all core scenarios
- [ ] Code is clean, documented, and maintainable
