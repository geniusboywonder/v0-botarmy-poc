## Task 1: WebSocket Connection Stability - âœ… COMPLETED

### Task 1.1: Fix Navigation-Based Disconnection âœ… COMPLETED
- **Issue:** WebSocket disconnects when navigating away from Dashboard
- **Files Modified:**
  - âœ… Created `lib/context/websocket-provider.tsx` - Global connection management
  - âœ… Updated `components/client-provider.tsx` - Added WebSocketProvider wrapper
  - âœ… Updated `app/page.tsx` - Removed local WebSocket cleanup that was killing connection
  - âœ… Enhanced `lib/websocket/websocket-service.ts` - Improved reconnection logic

### Task 1.2: Improve Backend Session Management âœ… COMPLETED
- **Enhanced reconnection logic** with better user feedback
- **Navigation change detection** for SPA routing
- **Connection persistence** across page navigation
- **Heartbeat handling** remains intact and functional

**Result:** WebSocket connection now managed globally and should persist across navigation.
