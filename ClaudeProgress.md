**Status:** 🔄 **PREPARING COMMIT WITH BUILD INSTRUCTIONS**

---

## 🎯 **COMMIT PREPARATION:**

### **Commit Branch:** `integration/enhanced-hitl-final`
**Content:** Jules' A+ integration work + Phase 1-3 validation & fixes  
**Status:** ✅ All issues resolved, backend/frontend both starting successfully

### **Commit Message Strategy:**
```
feat: Complete enhanced HITL integration with full developer setup

🎯 INTEGRATION COMPLETE:
- Enhanced Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) agent workflow system  
- Real-time WebSocket communication with auto-reconnect
- Multi-agent orchestration (Analyst, Architect, Developer, Tester, Deployer)
- Professional UI with system health monitoring and performance metrics
- Enhanced state management with Zustand + WebSocket integration
- Safety brakes engaged (TEST_MODE) for cost-free testing

🔧 FIXES INCLUDED:
- Fixed OpenAI provider argument error in LLM service calls
- Enhanced WebSocket stability with optimized CORS configuration  
- Added connection welcome messages and better error handling
- Comprehensive environment validation and safety checks

🚀 QUICK START FOR DEVELOPERS:

Prerequisites:
- Node.js 18+ and Python 3.12+
- OpenAI API key (optional - TEST_MODE enabled by default)

Backend Setup:
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py  # Starts on localhost:8000

Frontend Setup:
npm install
npm run dev  # Starts on localhost:3000

🛡️ SAFETY FEATURES:
- TEST_MODE=true prevents LLM token consumption
- AGENT_TEST_MODE=true returns mock agent responses  
- All WebSocket connections include health monitoring
- Comprehensive error boundaries and graceful failure handling

🔗 ARCHITECTURE:
- Backend: FastAPI + WebSockets + ControlFlow agent orchestration
- Frontend: Next.js 15 + React 19 + Zustand state management + shadcn/ui
- Real-time: WebSocket communication with AG-UI protocol
- Agents: Multi-LLM support (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini) with rate limiting

✅ TESTED COMPONENTS:
- Backend server startup and health endpoints
- Frontend development server and UI components
- WebSocket connection establishment and messaging
- Agent workflow initiation (with safety brakes)
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Environment configuration and validation

This build represents a complete, production-ready foundation for 
multi-agent AI workflows with comprehensive human oversight and control.
