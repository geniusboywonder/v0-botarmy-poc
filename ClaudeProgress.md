## üìù Detailed Notes

### **What's Working Well:**
- WebSocket communication is solid and reliable
- Test mode provides excellent development experience
- UI foundation is clean and responsive
- Backend infrastructure is well-architected
- Full agent workflow is now implemented and integrated.
- Agent status is now broadcast with progress and displayed in the UI.
- Error recovery with retries is now implemented in the workflow.
- Agent status cards are now displayed in a clean, responsive grid.
- A workflow progress UI provides high-level feedback to the user.

### **What's Ready for Production:**
- WebSocket service with auto-reconnect
- All UI components and layout
- Environment configuration system
- Test mode for safe development
- Core 5-agent workflow orchestration with error recovery
- Real-time agent status display in a grid
- Workflow progress indicator

## üîç Architecture Decisions Made

### **WebSocket Protocol**:
- Clean message types with proper routing
- Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff
- Session management with global_session for MVP
- Unified `agent_status` message for all status updates.
- New `workflow_progress` message type for overall progress.

### **Agent Test Mode**:
- Role confirmations instead of full LLM processing
- Configurable via AGENT_TEST_MODE environment variable
- Saves tokens during development and testing

### **Frontend State Management**:
- Zustand stores for agent and log state
- Real-time updates via WebSocket message handling
- Clean separation between UI and data logic
- New Zustand store for workflow progress.
