# Gemini UI/UX Review

This document outlines the findings of a UI/UX review of the BotArmy application, conducted by Gemini.

## Overall Impressions

The BotArmy application has a modern, professional, and consistent design. The dark theme is well-executed, and the layout is generally clean and organized. The application is intuitive to navigate, and the information is presented clearly.

## General Recommendations

*   **Consistency:** While the application is generally consistent, there are a few minor inconsistencies in alignment and styling that should be addressed.
*   **Visual Cues:** The application makes good use of visual cues, but some could be enhanced to improve clarity and usability.
*   **Empty States:** The empty states for "Tasks" and "Artifacts" are a bit plain. Adding icons or illustrations could make them more engaging.
*   **Readability:** The JSON logs are difficult to read. A more formatted or interactive view would be a significant improvement.
