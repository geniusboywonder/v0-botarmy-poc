## üõ†Ô∏è **Testing Environment Setup**

### **Step 1: Start the Application**
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd /Users/neill/Documents/AI Code/Projects/v0-botarmy-poc
source venv/bin/activate
python start_backend.py

# Terminal 2 - Frontend  
cd /Users/neill/Documents/AI Code/Projects/v0-botarmy-poc
npm run dev
```

### **Step 2: Open Testing URLs**
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend Health**: http://localhost:8000/api/health
- **WebSocket**: ws://localhost:8000/ws

### **Step 3: Browser Setup**
- Open multiple browser tabs for cross-tab testing
- Open Developer Tools Console for error monitoring
- Enable Network tab to monitor WebSocket connections

## üîç **Detailed Testing Procedures**

### **Test 1: Enhanced Chat Interface**
1. Navigate to main dashboard
2. Verify connection status shows "Connected" (green)
3. Enter test message: "Create a simple Python script"
4. Verify:
   - Message appears in chat with user badge
   - System response appears with "Initializing agents..."
   - Typing indicator shows when agents are working
   - Progress bars appear for agent tasks
   - Auto-scroll keeps latest messages visible

### **Test 2: System Health Dashboard**
1. Navigate to a page with health dashboard
2. Verify service status cards show:
   - Backend API (should be green/healthy)
   - WebSocket (should be green/connected)  
   - Agent services (status depends on backend)
3. Test manual refresh button
4. Verify metrics display reasonable values
5. Test quick action buttons

### **Test 3: Performance Metrics Overlay**
1. Toggle overlay on (look for activation method)
2. Drag overlay to different positions
3. Minimize and maximize overlay
4. Verify real-time metrics update every 2 seconds
5. Check mini-charts show data trends
6. Verify color coding for performance thresholds

### **Test 4: State Persistence**
1. Generate some logs and agent activity
2. Refresh the browser page
3. Verify:
   - Agent states persist
   - Log history remains
   - Performance overlay position remembered
   - Settings and preferences maintained

### **Test 5: Real-time Synchronization**
1. Open application in two browser tabs
2. Generate activity in one tab
3. Verify updates appear in both tabs
4. Test WebSocket disconnection/reconnection:
   - Stop backend
   - Verify "Disconnected" status shows
   - Restart backend
   - Verify auto-reconnection works

# Verify environment setup
npm list
pip list
```
