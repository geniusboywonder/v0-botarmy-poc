## 🚨 Critical Success Indicators

**MVP is Ready When These Work**:
1. [ ] User enters project brief → All 5 agents respond in sequence
2. [ ] Agent status cards update in real-time during workflow
3. [ ] Both test mode and full mode function properly
4. [ ] Error handling prevents system crashes
5. [ ] WebSocket communication stays stable throughout

**Demo Scenarios to Test**:
1. [ ] "Create a simple todo app" in test mode (should complete in ~30 seconds)
2. [ ] "Build a REST API for a bookstore" in test mode
3. [ ] Network interruption during workflow (should recover)
4. [ ] Backend restart during workflow (should handle gracefully)
5. [ ] Switch between test mode and full mode

## 🔧 Core Components Status

| Component | Current Status | Target Status | Owner |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|--------|
| **WebSocket Service** | ✅ Complete | ✅ Complete | Jules (Done) |
| **Basic Backend** | ✅ Complete | ✅ Complete | Jules (Done) |
| **Full Agent Workflow** | ❌ Incomplete | ✅ Must Complete | Jules |
| **Agent Status UI** | ❌ Basic Only | ✅ Must Complete | Jules |
| **Error Handling** | ❌ Basic Only | ✅ Should Complete | Jules |
| **Integration Testing** | ❌ None | ✅ Must Complete | Jules |

---

## 🎯 Architecture Decisions Already Made

**These are SOLID and should not be changed**:
- ✅ WebSocket communication pattern (excellent work)
<<<<<<< HEAD
- ✅ Test mode system (brilliant for development)  
=======
- ✅ Test mode system (brilliant for development)
>>>>>>> origin/feature/add-test-framework
- ✅ Frontend state management with Zustand
- ✅ Backend FastAPI structure with proper error handling
- ✅ Agent base classes and organization
- ✅ Environment configuration system

**Focus on COMPLETING, not CHANGING**:
Jules should build on the excellent foundation rather than redesigning.

## 📝 Key Files to Monitor

**Backend Files Jules Will Modify**:
- `backend/workflow.py` - Core agent orchestration
<<<<<<< HEAD
- `backend/main.py` - Full workflow integration  
=======
- `backend/main.py` - Full workflow integration
>>>>>>> origin/feature/add-test-framework
- `backend/agent_status_broadcaster.py` - Enhanced status updates
- `backend/error_handler.py` - Improved error handling

**Frontend Files Jules Will Modify**:
- `components/agent-status-card.tsx` - Real-time agent display
- `components/workflow-progress.tsx` - Overall progress indicator
- `lib/websocket/websocket-service.ts` - Handle new message types
- `lib/stores/agent-store.ts` - Enhanced agent state management

**New Files Jules Will Create**:
- `components/workflow-progress.tsx` - Progress visualization
- `tests/test_full_workflow.py` - End-to-end testing
- `components/agent-grid.tsx` - Agent layout component

## 🚨 Red Flags to Watch For

**If Jules Reports These Issues**:
1. **"WebSocket keeps disconnecting"** → Check if backend is running properly
<<<<<<< HEAD
2. **"Agent status not updating in UI"** → Check message handling in WebSocket service  
=======
2. **"Agent status not updating in UI"** → Check message handling in WebSocket service
>>>>>>> origin/feature/add-test-framework
3. **"Full workflow hangs"** → Check agent execution and error handling
4. **"Test mode not working"** → Check AGENT_TEST_MODE environment variable
5. **"Frontend crashes"** → Check error boundaries and state management

**Escalation Triggers**:
- Any task taking >150% of estimated time
- Critical functionality not working after implementation
- Architectural questions about existing patterns
- Integration issues between frontend and backend
