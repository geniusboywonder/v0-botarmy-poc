# BotArmy Development Plan (v2 - Library-Aware) - FINAL

## 1. Overall Goal

To implement the core backend architecture for BotArmy by integrating the `ControlFlow` library for orchestration and the `AG-UI` protocol for communication. This plan is the definitive roadmap for building the agentic backend.

---

## Phase 1: Foundational Integration (`ControlFlow` + `AG-UI`) - âœ… COMPLETED

**Objective:** To establish a working connection between the `ControlFlow` orchestration engine and the `AG-UI` frontend communication protocol.

*(Tasks omitted for brevity as phase is complete)*

---

## Phase 2: Agent Implementation - âœ… COMPLETED

**Objective:** To replace the placeholder tasks with real, LLM-powered agents that perform the SDLC functions.

*(Tasks omitted for brevity as phase is complete)*

---

## Phase 3: Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Integration - ðŸ›‘ HALTED

**Objective:** To leverage `ControlFlow`'s user interaction features to implement the required HITL functionality.

**Status:** Work on this phase has been halted as per user instruction. The project is being finalized in its current state.

---

## Phase 4: Feature Migration & Finalization - ðŸ›‘ HALTED

**Objective:** To migrate the existing features (Artifacts, etc.) to be compatible with the new event-driven, `ControlFlow`-based architecture.

**Status:** Work on this phase has been halted.
