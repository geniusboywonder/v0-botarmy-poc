# Instructions for Jules - BotArmy MVP Completion

**Project**: BotArmy POC  
**Phase**: Core Agent Workflow Completion  
**Target**: Robust, demonstrable MVP  
**Timeline**: 8 tasks over 2-3 days  
**Start Date**: August 23, 2025

---

## 🎯 Strategic Overview

Jules, your Phase 1 WebSocket stabilization work was **excellent** - the foundation is solid and production-ready. Now we need to complete the core agent workflow to make BotArmy a fully functional MVP.

**Current State**: We have a great foundation but the core agent orchestration needs completion  
**Goal**: Transform from "basic messaging" to "full multi-agent workflow"  
**Focus**: Reliability, error handling, and user experience

---

## 📋 Task Breakdown (8 Core Tasks)

### **Task 1: Complete Full Agent Workflow** (3 hours) 🔴 **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Objective**: Make the 5-agent sequential workflow work reliably in `backend/main.py`

**Current Issue**: The main.py backend has the structure but the full agent orchestration isn't working properly

**What to Build**:
1. **Enhanced workflow execution** in `backend/workflow.py`:
   - Sequential execution: Analyst → Architect → Developer → Tester → Deployer
   - Proper handoff between agents with context passing
   - Error handling for individual agent failures
   - Progress tracking throughout the workflow

2. **Integration with main.py**:
   - Connect the `start_project` command to trigger full workflow
   - Ensure test mode works (agents return role confirmations)
   - Ensure full mode works (agents make actual LLM calls)
   - Stream agent responses back to frontend via WebSocket

**Key Implementation Requirements**:
```python
# In backend/workflow.py - enhance this pattern
async def run_complete_workflow(project_brief: str, session_id: str, test_mode: bool = False):
    """
    Execute the full 5-agent workflow with proper error handling
    """
    agents = ["analyst", "architect", "developer", "tester", "deployer"]
    results = {}
    
    for agent_name in agents:
        try:
            # Broadcast agent starting status
            await broadcast_agent_status(agent_name, "starting", session_id)
            
            # Get agent result (test mode or real LLM)
            if test_mode:
                result = get_test_mode_response(agent_name, project_brief)
            else:
                result = await execute_agent_task(agent_name, project_brief, results)
            
            results[agent_name] = result
            
            # Broadcast agent completion
            await broadcast_agent_status(agent_name, "completed", session_id)
            await broadcast_agent_response(agent_name, result, session_id)
            
        except Exception as e:
            # Handle agent failure gracefully
            await broadcast_agent_error(agent_name, str(e), session_id)
            # Continue with remaining agents or stop based on error type
    
    return results
```

**Integration Points**:
- Must integrate with your existing WebSocket message broadcasting
- Should use the existing agent classes in `backend/agents/`
- Must respect the AGENT_TEST_MODE environment variable
- Should broadcast status updates to the frontend in real-time

**Success Criteria**:
- User can run "start_project" and see all 5 agents execute in sequence
- Test mode returns role confirmations quickly
- Full mode makes real LLM calls (when test mode disabled)
- Agent failures don't crash the entire workflow
- Frontend receives real-time status updates

**Files to Modify**:
- `backend/workflow.py` - Main workflow logic
- `backend/main.py` - Integration with WebSocket command handling
- Potentially `backend/agents/base_agent.py` - Enhanced error handling

---

### **Task 2: Enhance Agent Status Broadcasting** (2 hours) 🔴 **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Objective**: Make agent status updates visible in the frontend UI in real-time

**Current Issue**: Agent status updates happen in backend but frontend doesn't show them clearly

**What to Build**:
1. **Enhanced status messages** in `backend/agent_status_broadcaster.py`:
   - Clear agent state transitions (idle → working → completed → error)
   - Progress information (what the agent is currently doing)
   - Time estimates and completion percentages
   - Rich status context for better UI display

2. **Frontend agent status display** in `components/agent-status-card.tsx`:
   - Visual indicators for agent states (colors, icons, progress bars)
   - Current task descriptions
   - Real-time status updates without page refresh
   - Error state display with clear error messages

**Status Message Schema** (extend existing pattern):
```typescript
{
  type: "agent_status",
  data: {
    agent_name: "analyst",
    status: "working" | "completed" | "error" | "idle",
    current_task: "Analyzing project requirements...",
    progress_percentage: 45,
    estimated_completion: "2 minutes",
    error_message?: "OpenAI API rate limit exceeded"
  },
  timestamp: "2025-08-23T10:30:00Z",
  session_id: "global_session"
}
```

**Frontend Integration**:
- Agent cards should update immediately when status messages arrive
- Progress bars should animate smoothly
- Error states should be clearly visible with retry options
- Completed states should show final output summary

**Success Criteria**:
- User sees real-time agent status updates in the UI
- Progress is clearly communicated with percentages and descriptions
- Error states are obvious and actionable
- Status updates work in both test mode and full mode
- No UI flickering or state confusion

**Files to Modify**:
- `backend/agent_status_broadcaster.py` - Enhanced status messages
- `components/agent-status-card.tsx` - Real-time status display
- `lib/websocket/websocket-service.ts` - Handle agent_status messages
- `lib/stores/agent-store.ts` - Update agent state from WebSocket

---

### **Task 3: Improve Error Recovery System** (2 hours) 🟡 **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Objective**: Make the system resilient to common failures (network, API limits, etc.)

**What to Build**:
1. **Enhanced error handling** in `backend/error_handler.py`:
   - Categorize error types (network, API, validation, system)
   - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Graceful degradation for different error scenarios
   - Error logging and reporting to frontend

2. **Agent-level error recovery**:
   - Retry failed agent tasks up to 3 times
   - Continue workflow with other agents if one fails
   - Provide fallback responses for critical failures
   - Clear error communication to users

**Error Handling Pattern**:
```python
async def execute_agent_with_recovery(agent_name: str, task_data: dict, max_retries: int = 3):
    """Execute agent task with automatic retry and recovery"""
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return await execute_agent_task(agent_name, task_data)
        except APIRateLimitError:
            # Wait and retry with exponential backoff
            await asyncio.sleep(2 ** attempt)
            continue
        except NetworkError:
            # Short wait for network issues
            await asyncio.sleep(1)
            continue
        except ValidationError as e:
            # Don't retry validation errors
            raise AgentExecutionError(f"Invalid input for {agent_name}: {e}")
    
    # All retries failed
    raise AgentExecutionError(f"Agent {agent_name} failed after {max_retries} attempts")
```

**Success Criteria**:
- System continues working when individual agents fail
- API rate limit errors are handled gracefully
- Network failures trigger appropriate retries
- Users get clear error messages with suggested actions
- Errors are logged properly for debugging

**Files to Modify**:
- `backend/error_handler.py` - Enhanced error handling
- `backend/workflow.py` - Integration of error recovery
- Frontend components - Display error messages clearly

---

### **Task 4: Frontend Agent Status Display** (1.5 hours) 🔴 **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Objective**: Create a clean, informative agent status display in the UI

**What to Build**:
1. **Enhanced agent status cards**:
   - Clean visual design with status colors
   - Progress bars for active agents
   - Current task descriptions
   - Time remaining estimates
   - Error state indicators

2. **Agent grid layout**:
   - Responsive grid showing all 5 agents
   - Clear visual hierarchy (active agent emphasized)
   - Sequential flow indication (arrows between agents)
   - Overall workflow progress bar

**UI Design Pattern**:
```tsx
// Agent status card component structure
<AgentStatusCard>
  <AgentIcon status={agent.status} />
  <AgentInfo>
    <AgentName>{agent.name}</AgentName>
    <AgentRole>{agent.role}</AgentRole>
    <CurrentTask>{agent.currentTask}</CurrentTask>
  </AgentInfo>
  <ProgressSection>
    <ProgressBar value={agent.progress} />
    <TimeEstimate>{agent.timeRemaining}</TimeEstimate>
  </ProgressSection>
  <StatusIndicator status={agent.status}>
    {getStatusIcon(agent.status)}
    {getStatusText(agent.status)}
  </StatusIndicator>
</AgentStatusCard>
```

**Success Criteria**:
- Agent status is immediately clear from visual design
- Users understand which agent is currently active
- Progress information is helpful and accurate
- Error states are obvious and actionable
- Design is clean and professional

**Files to Modify**:
- `components/agent-status-card.tsx` - Main agent card component
- `components/agent-grid.tsx` - Layout for all agents
- `styles/` - CSS for status indicators and progress bars
- `lib/stores/agent-store.ts` - Ensure proper state management

---

### **Task 5: Workflow Progress UI** (2 hours) 🟡 **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

2. **Step-by-step progress indicator**:
   - Shows the 5 workflow phases as steps
   - Highlights current step
   - Shows completed steps with checkmarks
   - Indicates any failed steps clearly

**Progress UI Pattern**:
```tsx
<WorkflowProgress>
  <OverallProgress value={workflowProgress} />
  <StepIndicator>
    <Step status="completed">Analysis</Step>
    <Step status="active">Architecture</Step>
    <Step status="pending">Development</Step>
    <Step status="pending">Testing</Step>
    <Step status="pending">Deployment</Step>
  </StepIndicator>

    """Test the full agent workflow end-to-end"""
    # Start workflow
    result = await start_project("Create a simple todo app")
    
    # Verify all agents executed
    assert len(result.agent_results) == 5
    assert all(agent in result.agent_results for agent in 
              ["analyst", "architect", "developer", "tester", "deployer"])
    
    # Verify status updates were broadcast
    assert len(result.status_updates) >= 10  # Start/end for each agent
    
    # Verify no errors in test mode
