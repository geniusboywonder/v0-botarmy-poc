# MCP Role-Based Agent Orchestration

This document outlines how to design and prototype a **role-constrained multi-agent process** using **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.  
The idea is to create **specialized MCP services** (e.g., Business Analyst, Architect, Engineer, QA) and chain them together in a deterministic workflow.

---

## Concept Overview

- **MCP Services as Roles**  
  Each service is pre-configured with constraints for its role:
  - *Business Analyst MCP*: Extracts requirements, KPIs, constraints.
  - *Architect MCP*: Transforms requirements into system design.
  - *Engineer MCP*: Implements design (code, infrastructure).
  - *QA MCP*: Validates implementation against requirements.

- **Chaining Services**  
  The orchestrator passes **structured JSON outputs** from one role to the next.  
  No need for re-prompting at each step — role constraints are baked into the MCP service.

- **Benefits**  
  - No repetitive prompting  
  - Consistency & specialization  
  - Reusable services across projects  
  - Auditability of each stage

## 1. n8n Orchestration Prototype

### Flow: *Product Analysis → Design → Implementation → QA*

**Nodes:**

1. **Trigger Node** → Starts workflow  
2. **Business Analyst MCP Node** → Outputs structured requirements JSON  
3. **Architect MCP Node** → Takes requirements, returns system design JSON  
4. **Engineer MCP Node** → Produces code or infrastructure YAML  
5. **QA MCP Node** → Validates implementation against requirements  
6. **Storage Node** → Saves outputs (Google Sheets, Notion, Postgres, etc.)  

**Workflow Diagram (simplified)**

Trigger → BusinessAnalystMCP → ArchitectMCP → EngineerMCP → QAMCP → Storage

- Each MCP node connects via its API endpoint.  
- Input/output are passed as JSON.  
- n8n provides monitoring and re-runs for each stage.

## 2. Python-Based Orchestrator

For more flexibility, orchestration can be coded directly in Python.

```python
import requests

# MCP service endpoints
SERVICES = {
    "business_analyst": "http://localhost:8001/analyze",
    "architect": "http://localhost:8002/design",
    "engineer": "http://localhost:8003/implement",
    "qa": "http://localhost:8004/validate"
}

def call_service(service, payload):
    resp = requests.post(SERVICES[service], json=payload)
    return resp.json()

def orchestrate_pipeline(idea):
    # Step 1: Business Analyst
    requirements = call_service("business_analyst", {"idea": idea})
    
    # Step 2: Architect
    design = call_service("architect", requirements)
    
    # Step 3: Engineer
    implementation = call_service("engineer", design)
    
    # Step 4: QA
    validation = call_service("qa", {
        "requirements": requirements,
        "implementation": implementation
    })
    
    return {
        "requirements": requirements,
        "design": design,
        "implementation": implementation,
        "validation": validation
    }

if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = orchestrate_pipeline("AI-powered investment research assistant")
    print(result)
