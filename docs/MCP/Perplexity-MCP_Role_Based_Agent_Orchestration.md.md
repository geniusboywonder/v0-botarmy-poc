## 1. Overview

This document outlines a design pattern to build **role-specific AI agents** using the ModelContextProtocol (MCP). Each agent has a constrained role (e.g., Business Analyst), enforced by role schemas embedded into the MCP context. These agents can be chained together by an orchestration layer for complex workflows, reducing the need for detailed prompt engineering per step.

---

## 2. Role Schema Definition

Role schemas define the contract for each agent's behavior, inputs, outputs, and constraints.

Example schema for a Business Analyst:

{
"role": "Business Analyst",
"allowed_tasks": [
"data_analysis",
"trend_identification",
"report_generation"
],
"input_types": ["business_data", "queries"],
"output_types": ["analysis_report", "answers"],
"constraints": ["no_coding", "no_financial_advice"],
"context_access": ["business_metrics", "previous_reports"]
}

text

This schema ensures the agent operates strictly within the defined role boundaries.

## 3. Role-Constrained MCP Agents

Agents are implemented as MCP services wrapping LLMs with embedded role schema constraints:

- Filter context sent to the model to include only permitted data.
- Validate inputs against allowed tasks.
- Use internal role-based prompt templates.
- Return outputs conforming to role constraints.

Pseudocode illustration:

class MCPAgent:
def init(self, role_schema, model_client):
self.role = role_schema
self.model = model_client

text
def process_request(self, input_data, shared_context):
    filtered_context = {k: v for k, v in shared_context.items() if k in self.role['context_access']}
    if not self._is_valid_input(input_data):
        raise Exception("Input not allowed for this role")
    prompt = self._build_prompt(input_data, filtered_context)
    response = self.model.generate(prompt)
    return response

# Implement _is_valid_input and_build_prompt with role constraints

## 4. Orchestration Layer

A dedicated orchestration service manages:

- Invocation order of role agents.
- Passing and updating shared context between agents.
- Branching workflow logic based on agent outputs.
- Final aggregation and user response generation.

**Sample flow for a sales dip analysis:**

1. Data Engineer Agent preprocesses sales data.  
2. Business Analyst Agent analyzes trends.  
3. Product Manager Agent suggests prioritization.  
4. Financial Analyst Agent models financial impact.  
5. Final report compiled by orchestrator.

---

## 5. Context and State Management

- Use structured formats (e.g., JSON or graph DB) for shared context.  
- Context evolves with each step enriching or updating relevant fields.  
- MCP enforces context access per agent role.

---

## 6. Error Handling and Safeguards

- Validate inputs per role before processing.  
- Implement retries and timeout controls.  
- Provide fallback pathways for unhandled situations.  
- Log interactions for audit and debugging.

### Components

- **Client/User:** Originator of requests or queries.  
- **Orchestration Layer:** Coordinates the sequence of MCP agent calls, context passing, and branching logic.  
- **MCP Agents:** Each represents a constrained AI role with embedded schemas (Business Analyst, Data Engineer, etc.).  
- **Shared Context Store:** Central persistent layer maintaining workflow state and shared knowledge accessible per role.

---

## 8. Technology Stack Suggestions

- **LLMs:** OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude, or local models.  
- **MCP Implementation:** Custom MCP handlers with role-aware context filtering.  
- **Orchestration:** Python FastAPI microservice, Node.js, or workflow engines like Temporal or AWS Step Functions.  
- **Context Store:** Redis, MongoDB, Neo4j or other document/graph databases.  
- **Security:** OAuth and role-based access control mechanisms.

## 9. Summary

This pattern leverages the ModelContextProtocol to create **modular, role-specific AI agents** that work together under orchestration without needing heavy prompt engineering at each step. It promotes maintainability, scalability, and clearer AI process design, well-suited for workflows like business analysis pipelines or multi-disciplinary AI tasks.
