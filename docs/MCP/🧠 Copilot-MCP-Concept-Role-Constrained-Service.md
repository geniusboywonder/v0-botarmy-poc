🧠 Concept: Role-Constrained MCP Services
Definition: Each agent is instantiated with a constrained context (via MCP) that defines its role, capabilities, and boundaries. These agents are not general-purpose LLMs but specialized microservices with scoped cognition.

Example Roles:

📊 Business Analyst Agent: Only interprets data, identifies trends, and answers analysis-related queries.

🧪 Research Agent: Gathers and summarizes external knowledge, but doesn’t interpret or decide.

🧩 Synthesizer Agent: Combines outputs from other agents into actionable insights or decisions.

🔗 Chaining Agents Without Re-Prompting
Key Enabler: Use contextual handoff protocols and metadata tagging to pass structured outputs between agents. Each agent reads from a shared context object or message bus, not from raw prompts.

✅ Required Components:
Session ID + Flow Metadata: Ensures continuity and traceability.

Role-Specific MCP Templates: Predefined constraints and schemas per agent.

Inter-Agent Contracts: Define expected input/output formats and semantic boundaries.

Orchestration Layer: Handles sequencing, error recovery, and fallback logic.

🛠️ Implementation Blueprint
Layer Function Example
Agent MCP Defines role, scope, and allowed operations BusinessAnalystMCP: {role: "analysis", tools: ["trendDetection"], no_decision_making}
Context Bus Shared memory or message queue ContextStore[session_id].step_3.output → step_4.input
Orchestrator Manages flow, triggers agents FlowEngine.run("MarketAnalysisPipeline")
Validator Ensures outputs match expected schema OutputValidator.check(step_2.output, schema_2)
🧬 Example Flow: Market Analysis Pipeline

graph TD
    A[Data Ingestion Agent] --> B[Business Analyst Agent]
    B --> C[Insight Synthesizer Agent]
    C --> D[Report Generator Agent]
A: Pulls structured data from external APIs

B: Performs analysis, flags anomalies

C: Synthesizes insights across timeframes

D: Generates markdown/PDF report

Each agent only sees what it needs, and the orchestrator ensures smooth transitions without re-prompting.

🔮 Future Enhancements
Self-healing flows: Agents detect upstream failures and request retries or alternate paths.

Dynamic role reassignment: Agents can temporarily assume adjacent roles if context permits.

Audit trails: Every step logged with session ID, timestamp, and agent signature.

🔗 Integration in a Chained Flow
Here’s how this agent fits into a broader orchestrated pipeline:

🧠 Flow: MarketInsightPipeline
Step Agent MCP Role Output Next
1️⃣ DataIngestAgent Data Collector Structured JSON BusinessAnalystAgent
2️⃣ BusinessAnalystAgent Analyst Analysis Report InsightSynthesizerAgent
3️⃣ InsightSynthesizerAgent Synthesizer Strategic Summary ReportGeneratorAgent
4️⃣ ReportGeneratorAgent Formatter Markdown/PDF End
Each agent reads from the shared context and only acts within its defined MCP. No re-prompting is needed — the orchestrator simply routes validated outputs to the next agent.

🛡️ Benefits of MCP-Constrained Agents
Modularity: Swap agents without breaking the flow.

Security: Agents can’t overstep their roles.

Traceability: Every action is logged and auditable.

Scalability: Add new roles with minimal friction.

# 🧠 Role-Constrained Agent Architecture with Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## Overview

This document outlines a modular agent orchestration strategy using Model Context Protocols (MCPs). Each agent is constrained to a specific role and chained together in a process without requiring detailed prompts at each step.
