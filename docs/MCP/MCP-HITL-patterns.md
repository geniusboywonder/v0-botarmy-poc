# HITL Patterns - Human-in-the-Loop Collaboration

**Part of:** MCP-Based Role-Constrained Agent Orchestration  
**Focus:** Human-agent collaboration patterns and intervention strategies

---

## Human-in-the-Loop Architecture

The HITL system enables seamless collaboration between humans and AI agents, allowing for real-time intervention, guidance, and quality control throughout the workflow execution.

### Core HITL Principles

1. **Non-Disruptive Intervention** - Humans can intervene without breaking agent flow
2. **Context-Aware Handoffs** - Agents understand human feedback and adjust accordingly  
3. **Graduated Autonomy** - Varying levels of human oversight based on complexity and risk
4. **Learning from Intervention** - System improves based on human corrections
5. **Transparent Process** - Humans understand what agents are doing and why

## Intervention Points and Patterns

### 1. Pre-Workflow Intervention

**Pattern: Intent Clarification**
```python
class IntentClarificationGate:
    async def review_workflow_plan(self, user_request: str, proposed_workflow: dict) -> dict:
        """Allow human to review and modify workflow before execution"""
        
        clarification_needed = await self.assess_clarification_need(user_request, proposed_workflow)
        
        if clarification_needed["required"]:
            return await self.request_clarification(
                original_request=user_request,
                proposed_workflow=proposed_workflow,
                clarification_points=clarification_needed["points"],
                confidence_score=clarification_needed["confidence"]
            )
        
        return {"approved": True, "workflow": proposed_workflow}
    
    async def assess_clarification_need(self, user_request: str, workflow: dict) -> dict:
        """Assess if human clarification is needed before starting"""
        
        analysis_prompt = f"""
        Analyze if this workflow plan needs human clarification:
        
        Original Request: {user_request}
        Proposed Workflow: {workflow}
        
        Consider:
        - Is the user intent ambiguous?
        - Are there multiple valid interpretations?
        - Does the workflow match the likely user intent?
        - Are there high-risk assumptions being made?
        
        Return confidence score (0-1) and clarification points if needed.
        """
        
        analysis = await self.analysis_llm.complete(analysis_prompt)
        return json.loads(analysis)
    
    async def request_clarification(self, original_request: str, proposed_workflow: dict, 
                                  clarification_points: List[str], confidence_score: float) -> dict:
        """Request human clarification before workflow execution"""
        
        clarification_request = {
            "type": "clarification_required",
            "title": "Workflow Clarification Needed",
            "confidence_score": confidence_score,
            "original_request": original_request,
            "proposed_workflow": proposed_workflow,
            "questions": clarification_points,
            "suggested_modifications": await self.suggest_modifications(clarification_points),
            "timeout_minutes": 5
        }
        
        # Send to human for review
        response = await self.human_interface.request_clarification(clarification_request)
        
        if response["approved"]:
            return {
                "approved": True,
                "workflow": response.get("modified_workflow", proposed_workflow),
                "human_guidance": response.get("guidance", "")
            }
        else:
            return {
                "approved": False,
                "reason": response.get("reason", "User rejected workflow"),
                "alternative_request": response.get("alternative_request")
            }
```

**Pattern: Risk Assessment Gates**
```python
class RiskAssessmentGate:
    def __init__(self):
        self.risk_thresholds = {
            "data_sensitivity": 0.7,
            "cost_impact": 0.6,
            "business_criticality": 0.8,
            "technical_complexity": 0.75
        }
    
    async def assess_workflow_risk(self, workflow: dict, context: dict) -> dict:
        """Assess risk level of proposed workflow"""
        
        risk_factors = {}
