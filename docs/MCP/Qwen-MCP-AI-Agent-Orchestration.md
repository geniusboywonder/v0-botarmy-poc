# AI Agent Orchestration Using Model Context Protocol (MCP)

**Author**: AI Technical Expert  
**Date**: 2025-04-05  
**Goal**: Design a system where specialized LLM agents, defined via Model Context Protocol (MCP), can be dynamically chained in automated workflows to execute complex processes without manual prompting at each step.

## 🔍 Overview

This document outlines an architecture for building **role-constrained AI agents** using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** and orchestrating them in **automated, DAG-based workflows**. The goal is to enable reliable, scalable, and composable AI teams where each agent performs a specific role (e.g., Business Analyst, Data Engineer) within defined boundaries.

By leveraging MCP, agents are self-describing services with explicit capabilities, constraints, and interfaces — enabling them to be dynamically discovered, composed, and executed in a process flow.

## 🧩 Core Concepts

### 1. **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**

MCP is a **standardized interface** that defines how an LLM agent:

- Understands its **role and goals**
- Accesses **tools and data**
- Declares **permissions and limitations**
- Communicates **input/output schemas**

> Think of MCP as the **"OpenAPI spec for AI agents"** — a contract between the model, its context, and the orchestrator.

### 2. **Role-Constrained Agents**

Each agent is bound to a specific role (e.g., `Business Analyst`) with:

- A **system prompt template**
- A **set of allowed tools**
- **Prohibited actions**
- A **domain-specific context**

This ensures **role fidelity** and reduces hallucination or overreach.

### 3. **Workflow Orchestration**

Agents are chained in a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** using an orchestrator (e.g., Prefect, Airflow, custom engine). The orchestrator:

- Passes data between agents
- Enforces execution order
- Handles errors and retries
- Minimizes need for manual prompting

[Orchestrator (DAG Engine)]
         ↓
[Agent A: Data Engineer] → (cleans data)
         ↓
[Agent B: Business Analyst] → (generates insights)
         ↓
[Agent C: UX Researcher] → (interprets user impact)
         ↓
[Agent D: Product Manager] → (recommends actions)
