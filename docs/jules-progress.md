## 🎯 Current Focus

**Objective**: Transform BotArmy from "basic messaging" to "full multi-agent workflow"

**Key Success Criteria**:
1. User can start project → 5 agents respond in sequence
2. Agent status updates in real-time in UI
3. Both test mode and full mode work properly
4. Error handling prevents crashes
5. System is demo-ready and reliable

**Critical Path**: Tasks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 are essential for MVP completion

## 🚨 Important Notes for Jules

### **What's Already Perfect (Don't Change)**:
- ✅ WebSocket communication system
- ✅ Test mode implementation
- ✅ Backend infrastructure and error handling
- ✅ Frontend state management patterns
- ✅ Environment configuration system

### **What Needs Completion**:
- ❌ Full agent workflow orchestration (5 agents in sequence)
- ❌ Real-time agent status in UI
- ❌ Enhanced error recovery for agent failures
- ❌ Complete end-to-end testing

### **Build Pattern**:
**ENHANCE existing code, don't rebuild it**. Jules' Phase 1 foundation is excellent - Phase 2 should complete and polish what's already there.
