## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

* **Task 1: Enhanced Connection Manager**

  - **Description:** Replaced the basic ConnectionManager with a robust version that handles unique client IDs, metadata, and message queuing.
* **Task 2: Centralized Error Handler**
  - **Status:** Implemented, pending review.
  - **Description:** Created a centralized error handler to convert technical errors into user-friendly messages and integrated it into the backend.
* **Task 3: WebSocket Message Protocol Enhancement**
  - **Status:** Completed (Verified existing implementation).
  - **Description:** Analyzed the existing `MessageProtocol` class and confirmed it meets all task requirements for standardized messages. No new code was needed.
* **Task 4: Rate Limiter for OpenAI**
  - **Status:** Implemented, pending review.
  - **Description:** Implemented an asynchronous, token-based rate limiter and refactored the LLM service and agent architecture to be fully async.
* **Task 5: Enhanced LLM Service with Retries**
  - **Status:** Implemented, pending review.
  - **Description:** Enhanced the LLM service with a retry loop, exponential backoff, timeouts, and agent-specific fallback responses.
* **Task 6: Heartbeat and Health Monitoring**
  - **Status:** Implemented, pending review.
  - **Description:** Added a heartbeat mechanism to detect and disconnect dead client connections, improving connection stability.
* **Task 7: Agent Status Broadcasting**
	- **Status:** Implemented, pending review.
	- **Description:** Implemented a system to broadcast real-time agent status (started, thinking, completed, error) by hooking into the application's logging infrastructure.
* **Task 8: Improved Error Recovery in Workflow**
	- **Status:** Implemented, pending review.
	- **Description:** Refactored the main workflow to be resilient, allowing it to continue to the next agent even if one fails.
