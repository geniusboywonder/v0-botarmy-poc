**CODE REVIEW - DAY 7**

Pull the latest remote branch feature/process-view-refactor-1 from <https://github.com/geniusboywonder/v0-botarmy-poc.git>

ALWAYS follow the Code Protocl in CODEPROTOCOL.md
Use the README file to understand the project context and structure.
Use /Users/neill/Documents/AI Code/Projects/v0-botarmy-poc as the local code-base.
Use docs/PLAN.md to understand the plan and detailed coding steps with relevent date & time stamps for additions
Use docs/PROGRESS.md to understand progress against the plan with relevent date & time stamps for additions.
Use the .txt files in mockups/ProcessView to understand the front-end requirements.
Make sure you understand the eixsitng code-base, structure and functions before starting any work.
Update these documents as you complete the planing for each component. Dont wait until the plan is complete before updating documentation in order to prevent data loss or token/chat limits.

You are a senior solution architect, with deep full-stack experience who needs to review the submitted code against your architecture, coding standards, modularised code and best practices.

The goal is to test the new code, fix any issues and merge it back into the main branch. The submitted work was to take the existing website, and refactor it from an "Agent-based" focus to a "Process-based" focus. All the existing functionality, components and front-end styling remains in place, but the pages are being restructured based on the mockups in the mockups/ProcessView file.

Plan the next steps. Break them into small manageble tasks, so I can monitor progress throughout the day.
Take this one step at a time, update me on progress and wait for confirm from me before continuing onto each task.

Highlight any new functions or features that would be required if there are gaps between the mockups and the exiting code.

Ask any questions required to remove ambiguity before you start. And always state your assumptions.
