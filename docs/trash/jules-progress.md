## 🎯 Current Focus

**Objective**: Implement a series of enhancements to make the BotArmy POC a polished, production-ready solution.

**Key Success Criteria**:
1.  The chat window behaves like a normal chat with the LLM.
2.  The SDLC agent process is only kicked off when the user types "start project".
3.  All agent interactions and status updates are visible in the UI.
4.  The UI matches the provided mockups and design requirements.
5.  The application is robust, with proper error handling and no console errors.
6.  The system is reliable and ready for demonstration.
