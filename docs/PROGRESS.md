## 📋 Task Status Details

### 🔄 Task 00: Use Mockup as Reference for Dashboard Process Summary Element

**Goal:** Implement the mockup design as a working example for the current Dashboard Process Summary element.

**Status:** Planning Complete - Ready to Begin Implementation

**Requirements Analysis:**
- ✅ Reviewed existing codebase and components
- ✅ Analyzed mockup requirements 
- ✅ Created detailed implementation plan
- ✅ Identified files to modify

**Current State:**
- Found existing `SimplifiedProcessSummary` component with basic implementation
- Component needs enhancement to match mockup (add agent names, status indicators)
- Main dashboard currently uses `EnhancedProcessSummary` component

**Next Steps:**
1. Enhance `SimplifiedProcessSummary` component to match mockup exactly
2. Update main dashboard to use enhanced component
3. Perform visual validation and testing

**Files Identified for Modification:**
- `components/dashboard/simplified-process-summary.tsx` - Main enhancement target
- `app/page.tsx` - Dashboard integration
- Process store integration verification
