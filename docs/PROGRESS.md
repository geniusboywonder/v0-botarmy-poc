### âœ… Phase 4: HITL Integration

**Goal:** Implement the UI for approval checkpoints and notifications.

**Status:** Completed on 2025-09-04.

**Implementation Details:**
*   **Core HITL Infrastructure:**
    *   Created a new Zustand store for managing HITL requests at `lib/stores/hitl-store.ts`.
    *   Created the `HITLApprovalComponent` at `components/hitl/hitl-approval.tsx` to be rendered in the chat for approval requests.
    *   Integrated the `HITLApprovalComponent` with CopilotKit's `useCopilotAction` and `renderAndWaitForResponse` in `components/chat/copilot-chat.tsx`.
    *   Enhanced the agent status card to display a "HITL" badge for pending requests, with navigation to the relevant chat context.

*   **User Experience Polish:**
    *   Implemented a header alert system (`components/hitl/hitl-alerts.tsx`) to notify users of pending HITL requests.
    *   Added "kill switch" controls (`components/controls/kill-switch.tsx`) for pausing, resuming, and stopping agents.
    *   Implemented context-aware chat filtering to automatically show messages from the relevant agent when a HITL request is active.
