## âœ… COMPLETED TASKS

### âœ… Task 6: Chat Persistence Fix (COMPLETED 16:50 by Jules)
**Problem:** Cleared chat messages would reappear after navigating away and back, due to being stored in `localStorage`.
**Solution Applied:**
- Modified the Zustand persistence middleware for the conversation store to use `sessionStorage` instead of `localStorage`.
- This ensures the chat history is maintained only for the duration of the browser tab session, and is properly cleared when the session ends.

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/stores/conversation-store.ts` - Swapped `localStorage` for `sessionStorage`.

### âœ… Task 1-5 (Completed by Claude)
... (details of Claude's work remain the same) ...

### âœ… Task 1: Logs Page Display Fix (COMPLETED 15:25)
**Problem:** Test Backend and Test OpenAI buttons not showing messages in log viewer
**Solution Applied:**
- Fixed filtering logic to properly sync `filteredLogs` with `logs` when no filters applied
- Removed duplicate logging calls from WebSocket service 
- Added emoji indicators for test messages
- Enhanced error handling and debugging

**Files Modified:**
- `app/logs/page.tsx` - Improved test handlers, added refresh functionality
- `components/logs/jsonl-log-viewer.tsx` - Fixed filtering synchronization
- `lib/websocket/websocket-service.ts` - Removed duplicate addLog calls
- `lib/stores/log-store.ts` - Enhanced with safe storage and better filtering

### âœ… Task 2: Header Layout Fix (COMPLETED 15:35)
**Problem:** "Open ChatNotifications" text overlapping with icons
**Solution Applied:**
- Reduced gaps between action buttons (gap-4 â†’ gap-2)
- Added `flex-shrink-0` to prevent icon compression
- Improved responsive behavior (md:flex â†’ lg:flex for health indicator)
- Added proper tooltips and removed redundant spacing

**Files Modified:**
- `components/layout/header.tsx` - Layout improvements and spacing fixes

### âœ… Task 3: Process Summary Height Reduction (COMPLETED 15:45) 
**Problem:** Process summary taking too much vertical space above fold
**Solution Applied:**
- Reduced card height by 50% (h-28 â†’ h-14)
- Proportionally adjusted all content sizing (text-sm â†’ text-xs, etc.)
- Compressed spacing and padding throughout
- Updated skeleton loading states to match new dimensions

**Files Modified:**
- `components/dashboard/process-summary.tsx` - Height and spacing optimizations

### âœ… Task 4: Chat Interface Fix (COMPLETED 16:05)
**Problem:** Chat window growing with messages, bubbles too large, moving below fold
**Solution Applied:**  
- Fixed chat interface height (min-h-[600px] â†’ h-[400px])
- Reduced scroll area height (h-[400px] â†’ h-[250px])
- Tighter message spacing (px-4 py-2 â†’ px-3 py-1.5)
- Smaller message bubbles (p-3 â†’ p-2, space-x-3 â†’ space-x-2)
- Compressed text sizes (text-sm â†’ text-xs)

**Files Modified:**
- `components/chat/enhanced-chat-interface.tsx` - Layout and spacing improvements

### âœ… Task 5: Console Errors Fix (COMPLETED 16:30)
**Problem:** Zustand persist middleware errors + WebSocket warnings
**Solution Applied:**
- Implemented safe localStorage wrapper with error handling
- Added proper fallback when storage unavailable  
- Enhanced error recovery (clear storage and retry on quota exceeded)
- Added WebSocket message type handler for `artifacts_get_all`
- Improved connection cleanup and reduced warning log levels

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/stores/log-store.ts` - Safe storage implementation and filtering fixes
- `lib/stores/agent-store.ts` - Safe storage implementation  
- `backend/main.py` - Added artifacts_get_all handler, reduced log noise
