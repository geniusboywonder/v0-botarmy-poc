## Project Completion Summary

The refactoring of the BotArmy application from an agent-centric to a process-centric UI is now complete. All phases outlined in the project plan have been successfully executed. The new user interface provides a structured, intuitive workflow based on the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) stages.

### Key Achievements:
-   **New Layout:** A modern, responsive layout with a new header and a process-based sidebar has been implemented.
-   **Global Chat:** A globally accessible chat modal ensures constant communication with the agent team.
-   **Process Dashboard:** The main dashboard now provides a high-level overview of the entire SDLC process at a glance.
-   **Detailed Stage Pages:** Each stage of the SDLC has its own dedicated page, showing relevant tasks, artifacts, and configuration options.
-   **Centralized State Management:** A new `process-store` has been created to manage the state of the process view, ensuring data consistency.
-   **Real-time Integration:** The UI is connected to the WebSocket service for real-time updates.

The application is now ready for final review and submission.
