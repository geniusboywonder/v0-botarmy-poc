### âœ… Phase 4: HITL Integration

**Goal:** Implement the UI for approval checkpoints and notifications.

**Status:** Completed on 2025-09-04.

**Implementation Details:**
*   **Core HITL Infrastructure:**
    *   Created a new Zustand store for managing HITL requests at `lib/stores/hitl-store.ts`.
    *   Created the `HITLApprovalComponent` at `components/hitl/hitl-approval.tsx` to be rendered in the chat for approval requests.
    *   Integrated the `HITLApprovalComponent` with CopilotKit's `useCopilotAction` and `renderAndWaitForResponse` in `components/chat/copilot-chat.tsx`.
    *   Enhanced the agent status card to display a "HITL" badge for pending requests, with navigation to the relevant chat context.

*   **User Experience Polish:**
    *   Implemented a header alert system (`components/hitl/hitl-alerts.tsx`) to notify users of pending HITL requests.
    *   Added "kill switch" controls (`components/controls/kill-switch.tsx`) for pausing, resuming, and stopping agents.
    *   Implemented context-aware chat filtering to automatically show messages from the relevant agent when a HITL request is active.

   - âœ… **11 Artifacts**: 5 Execution Plans + 5 Main Documents + Project Brief
   - âœ… **Dependencies**: Execution Plans required before main artifacts
   - âœ… **Task Order**: Proper dependency resolution ensures correct execution sequence

**Technical Implementation Details:**

*   **Enhanced YAML Structure:**
    ```yaml
    stages:
      Analyze:
        tasks:
          - name: "Create Analysis Execution Plan"
            role: "Analyst"  
            input_artifacts: ["Project Brief"]
            output_artifacts: ["Analysis Execution Plan"]
          - name: "Execute Requirements Analysis"
            role: "Analyst"
            input_artifacts: ["Project Brief", "Analysis Execution Plan"]
            output_artifacts: ["Requirements Document"]
            depends_on: ["Create Analysis Execution Plan"]
    ```

*   **Dynamic Task Resolution:**
    - Parse YAML configuration for all stages and tasks
    - Build task dependency graph automatically
    - Execute tasks in proper order: Plan â†’ Execute â†’ Next Phase
    - Handle artifact chaining between stages

    ```

**System Requirements Met:**
- âœ… First artifact in each phase is an Execution Plan
- âœ… Execution Plans summarize artifacts to be produced in that phase
