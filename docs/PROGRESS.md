## Detailed Progress Log

### ‚úÖ Setup & Analysis (Completed 15:00)
**Duration:** 30 minutes  
**Status:** Complete

**Completed:**
- [x] Created new branch `fix/website-functionality-improvements`
- [x] Analyzed current codebase structure and architecture
- [x] Identified root causes for all 5 reported issues
- [x] Created detailed implementation plan in `docs/PLAN.md`
- [x] Set up progress tracking in `docs/PROGRESS.md`

**Key Findings:**
- Frontend uses Next.js 15.2.4 + React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- State management via Zustand with persistence middleware
- WebSocket service for real-time communication
- Issues are primarily UI/UX related, not architectural

**Files Examined:**
- `app/logs/page.tsx` - Logs page with test buttons
- `components/logs/jsonl-log-viewer.tsx` - JSONL log display component
- `components/layout/header.tsx` - Header bar layout
- `components/dashboard/process-summary.tsx` - Process summary cards
- `components/chat/enhanced-chat-interface.tsx` - Chat interface
- `lib/stores/log-store.ts` - Log state management
- `lib/websocket/websocket-service.ts` - WebSocket communication

**Next:** Begin Task 1 - Logs Page Display Fix

### üîÑ Task 1: Fix Logs Page Display (In Progress - 80%)
**Duration:** 30 minutes allocated  
**Status:** Debugging completed, implementing fix

**Problem Identified:**
Test Backend and Test OpenAI buttons calling `addLog()` but messages not appearing in JSONL viewer. Investigation revealed potential filtering issues and debounced log processing.

**Root Causes Found:**
- Log entries are being added to store correctly (confirmed via debugging)
- Issue appears to be in the filtering logic or initial filter state
- Debounced processing (50ms) may be causing display delays
- Double log entries from both page handlers AND websocket service

**Implementation Progress:**
- [x] Added comprehensive debugging to log viewer component
- [x] Created WIP versions with enhanced logging and state inspection
- [x] Identified filtering logic as potential issue
- [x] Added debug info display in UI for real-time troubleshooting
- [ ] Fix filtering initialization and state synchronization
- [ ] Remove duplicate log calls (either page OR websocket, not both)
- [ ] Test final implementation

**Files Modified:**
- `app/logs/page_WIP_20250829_1500.tsx` - Enhanced debugging in page
- `components/logs/jsonl-log-viewer_WIP_20250829_1505.tsx` - Debug-enabled viewer

**Next Steps:**
- Complete filtering fix and finalize working version
- Test with all button types to ensure proper display
