### 3.17 Artifacts Management

- Implement an "Artifacts" page in the dashboard UI as a sidebar navigation item to store and display outputs from all SDLC phases, primarily for the Product Owner to download artifacts
- Provide tabbed navigation within the Artifacts page for each SDLC phase:
  - **Requirements Gathering** (Analyst role): Store and display Requirements Document and Use Cases (.md or Word files)
  - **Design** (Architect role): Store and display Architecture Diagrams (.png/.jpeg/PDF) and Design Models (.md)
  - **Development** (Developer role): Store and display Source Code (.java/.py) and Code Documentation (.md)
  - **Testing** (Tester role): Store and display Test Plans (.md), Test Cases (.xlsx), and Test Scripts (.sh)
  - **Deployment** (Deployer role): Store and display Deployment Scripts (.sh/.yaml) and Configuration Files (.json/.xml)
  - **Maintenance** (Deployer role): Store and display Monitoring Reports (.md) and Logs (.txt), with real-time streaming of JSONL logs
- Display artifacts in a table format (columns: Document Name, Download Link) for all tabs except Development, flattening any folder structure for simplicity
- For the Development tab, display artifacts in a navigable folder tree view to handle large and hierarchical code structures
- Defer preview functionality for Markdown (.md), images (.png/.jpeg), and PDFs to a later phase
- Store artifacts in a backend folder structure (not exposed to users except via Development tab’s tree view):
  - /project-root/requirements/gathering (e.g., requirements.md, use_cases.md)
  - /project-root/design/architecture (e.g., architecture_diagram.png, design_model.md)
  - /project-root/development/source_code (e.g., main.java, utils.py) and /documentation (e.g., code_documentation.md)
  - /project-root/testing/test_plans (e.g., test_plan.md), /test_cases (e.g., test_cases.xlsx), /test_scripts (e.g., test_script.sh)
  - /project-root/deployment (e.g., deployment_script.sh, config.json)
  - /project-root/maintenance (e.g., monitoring_report.md, logs.txt)
- Allow dynamic folder hierarchy for Development artifacts based on Architect Agent decisions
- Generate and store artifacts automatically via the Message Bus after agent task completion, with updates to existing artifacts based on Product Owner feedback
- Use stubbed hosting for artifact storage (e.g., URLs like <https://yourserver.com/artifacts/{phase}/{artifact_name}>), integrated with GitHub Codespaces or Vercel, with final hosting details to be determined by the Architect
- Ensure real-time updates to the Artifacts page via WebSockets when new or updated artifacts are generated
- Handle large Development artifacts efficiently with compression, without versioning for the POC

### 3.18 User Settings

- Implement a Settings page in the dashboard UI, accessible via sidebar navigation, to manage user preferences and agent configurations
- Include settings for:
  - Theme toggle (light/dark mode) for UI customization
  - Notifications toggle to enable/disable in-app notifications
  - Agent role assignment, allowing Product Owner to map specific roles (e.g., Analyst, Architect) to agents from .md files (e.g., role definitions in analyst_role.md)
- Persist settings in client-side storage (IndexedDB) with real-time synchronization across tabs
- Provide validation for role assignments to ensure compatibility with SDLC roles and agent capabilities
- Ensure settings changes trigger immediate UI updates and log events via Message Bus

Ideally what I want is the Human in loop to be in control throughout the process and to be able to direct the next step of the workflow or get each agent to pause their tasks. This should happen via conversation in the chat window, whereby the agents explain what they are doing and ask for permission to proceed before doing do. A "pause button" in each of the agent boxes would also be useful.

In addition the system should be aware of the rate limits of using OpenAI and not exceed these at any time.

This enhanced Product Specification Document provides a comprehensive foundation for the BotArmy POC development, incorporating all architectural decisions, detailed requirements for frontend and backend implementation, and updated UI and functionality based on the mockup.
