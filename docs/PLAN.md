# BotArmy Project Plan - Interactive Workflow Frontend

**Date**: September 2, 2025
**Role**: Senior Front-End Developer
**Project**: v0-botarmy-poc
**Following**: CODEPROTOCOL, STYLEGUIDE, and FINALTEST.md

This plan outlines the frontend implementation for the 10-step interactive workflow. The backend implementation (Phases 1 & 2) is considered complete as per `docs/FINALTEST.md`. This plan covers Phases 3-6.

---

## 1. **Setup and Documentation Update:**
    *   I will first align the project's documentation with the current task. I will overwrite the contents of `docs/PLAN.md` with this new plan.
    *   I will then reset `docs/PROGRESS.md` to indicate the start of the interactive workflow frontend implementation, marking Phase 1 and 2 as complete on the backend.

## 2.  **Phase 3: UI State Integration:**
    *   **Artifact Scaffolding Store:** I will create the `lib/stores/artifact-scaffolding-store.ts` file using Zustand, as specified in `FINALTEST.md`. This store will manage the state of scaffolded artifacts displayed in the UI.
    *   **Interactive Chat Component:** I will create the `components/chat/requirements-gathering-interface.tsx` component. This component will be responsible for handling the interactive question-and-answer session with the user during the requirements gathering phase.

## 3.  **Phase 4: Human-In-the-Loop (HITL) Integration:**
    *   **Approval Notification System:** I will identify the existing notification system and extend it to manage approval requests for HITL checkpoints, including handling timeouts.
    *   **User Approval UI:** I will implement the UI components necessary for the user to view and act on these approval requests (e.g., an "Approve" button in the chat or a notification).

## 4.  **Phase 5: Artifact Management UI:**
    *   **Artifact Display:** I will enhance the UI to display both scaffolded and completed artifacts, organized by their respective stages in the workflow. This will likely involve modifications to the process summary or artifacts page.
    *   **Artifact Interaction:** I will add functionality for users to view and download the generated artifacts.

## 5.  **Testing and Verification:**
    *   As I implement the above features, I will write unit and integration tests for the new components and stores to ensure they are working correctly, following the guidance in `FINALTEST.md`.

## 6.  **Frontend Verification:**
    *   Once the implementation is complete and manually verified, I will use the `frontend_verification_instructions` tool to write a Playwright script, test the end-to-end flow, and generate a screenshot to confirm the UI changes.
