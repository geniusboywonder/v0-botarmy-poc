# Project Brief: debug

## Clear Objectives and Requirements
The objective of this project is to design a system that allows developers to debug their code efficiently and effectively. The system should provide tools and features that help identify and fix errors in the code, as well as track the debugging process. The system should also be user-friendly and intuitive to use.

## Technical Specifications
- The system will be web-based, accessible through a web browser.
- The system will support multiple programming languages, including but not limited to Java, Python, and JavaScript.
- The system will have a code editor with syntax highlighting and auto-completion features.
- The system will have a debugger tool that allows users to set breakpoints, step through code, and inspect variables.
- The system will have a console window that displays debugging output and error messages.
- The system will have a version control feature that allows users to save and revert changes.
- The system will have a user authentication system to ensure data security.

## Implementation Details
- The system will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.
- The backend will be implemented using Node.js with Express for the server and MongoDB for the database.
- The code editor will be implemented using a library like CodeMirror.
- The debugger tool will be implemented using a library like Chrome Developer Tools.
- The console window will be implemented using a custom logging system.
- The version control feature will be implemented using Git integration.

## Dependencies and Assumptions
- The system will depend on external libraries and tools for code editing and debugging.
- The system will assume that users have basic knowledge of debugging techniques and programming languages.
- The system will assume that users have a stable internet connection for accessing the web-based system.

Overall, the debug system aims to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly debugging environment for developers to identify and fix errors in their code efficiently.
