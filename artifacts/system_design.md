# System Design: Simple Calculator App

## Objective
The objective of this project is to create a simple calculator app with a React frontend and an Express backend. The app should allow users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Requirements
1. User-friendly interface for inputting numbers and selecting operations
2. Ability to perform basic arithmetic operations
3. Real-time calculation results displayed to the user
4. Error handling for invalid inputs

## Technical Specifications
- Frontend: React
- Backend: Express
- Database: Not required for this project
- Communication: RESTful API
- Dependencies: npm, React, Express, etc.

## Implementation Details
1. Frontend:
   - Create components for input fields, operation buttons, and result display
   - Handle user input and send requests to the backend
   - Display real-time calculation results to the user

2. Backend:
   - Create routes for handling arithmetic operations
   - Implement logic for performing calculations based on user input
   - Return results to the frontend for display

3. Communication:
   - Frontend will send requests to the backend using RESTful API endpoints
   - Backend will process requests and return results to the frontend

4. Error Handling:
   - Validate user input to ensure it is a valid number and operation
   - Display error messages to the user for invalid inputs

## Dependencies and Assumptions
1. Dependencies:
   - React and related libraries for frontend development
   - Express and related libraries for backend development
   - npm for package management

2. Assumptions:
   - The app will be used on modern web browsers that support React
   - The backend will be hosted on a server that can handle API requests

By following these specifications and details, we can create a simple calculator app with a React frontend and Express backend that meets the project requirements.
