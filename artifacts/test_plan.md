# Test Plan for Simple Calculator App

## Objective
The objective of this test plan is to ensure the functionality, usability, and performance of the simple calculator app with a React frontend and Express backend. The app should be able to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Requirements
1. The app should have a user-friendly interface with buttons for numbers, arithmetic operations, and a display for the result.
2. The app should be able to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations accurately.
3. The app should handle edge cases such as dividing by zero and inputting invalid characters gracefully.
4. The app should be responsive and work on different devices and screen sizes.
5. The app should have error handling to provide feedback to the user in case of any issues.

## Technical Specifications
- Frontend: React
- Backend: Express
- Database: Not required for this app
- Testing framework: Jest for frontend testing, Mocha and Chai for backend testing

## Implementation Details
1. Frontend Testing:
- Test the rendering of the calculator components.
- Test the functionality of the arithmetic operations.
- Test the error handling for invalid inputs.

2. Backend Testing:
- Test the API endpoints for performing arithmetic operations.
- Test the error handling for edge cases such as dividing by zero.

3. Integration Testing:
- Test the communication between the frontend and backend.
- Test the overall functionality of the app.

## Dependencies
1. Node.js and npm for installing dependencies and running the app.
2. React and Express frameworks for frontend and backend development.
3. Jest, Mocha, and Chai for testing the app.
4. Internet connection for running the app and fetching dependencies.

## Assumptions
1. The calculator app will run on modern browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
2. The app will be deployed on a server that supports Node.js and Express.
3. Users will have basic knowledge of arithmetic operations and how to use a calculator.

## Conclusion
This test plan outlines the objectives, requirements, technical specifications, implementation details, dependencies, and assumptions for testing the simple calculator app with a React frontend and Express backend. By following this plan, we aim to ensure the app's functionality, usability, and performance.
