# Test Plan: Debug

## Objective:
The objective of this test plan is to ensure that the debug feature in the software operates as expected and effectively identifies and resolves issues in the code.

## Requirements:
1. The debug feature should be able to identify and display errors in the code.
2. The debug feature should provide detailed information about the errors, such as line numbers and error messages.
3. The debug feature should allow the user to step through the code to identify the source of the error.
4. The debug feature should provide options for setting breakpoints and watching variables.
5. The debug feature should have a user-friendly interface for ease of use.

## Technical Specifications:
- Programming language: Java
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE): IntelliJ IDEA
- Testing framework: JUnit
- Operating System: Windows 10

## Implementation Details:
1. Unit Testing:
- Use JUnit to write unit tests for the debug feature.
- Test cases should cover all possible scenarios, such as different types of errors and breakpoints.
- Ensure that the debug feature functions correctly in isolation.

2. Integration Testing:
- Integrate the debug feature with the software application.
- Test the interaction between the debug feature and other components of the software.
- Ensure that the debug feature does not impact the performance of the software.

3. User Acceptance Testing:
- Conduct user acceptance testing with a group of users.
- Gather feedback on the usability and effectiveness of the debug feature.
- Make any necessary improvements based on user feedback.

## Dependencies:
1. Availability of the software application for integration testing.
2. Access to a development environment with IntelliJ IDEA and JUnit installed.
3. Availability of testers and users for user acceptance testing.

## Assumptions:
1. The debug feature has been implemented according to the requirements specified.
2. The software application is stable and does not have major bugs that would interfere with testing the debug feature.
3. Testers have the necessary skills and knowledge to effectively test the debug feature.

By following this test plan, we aim to ensure that the debug feature in the software operates effectively and provides users with the tools they need to identify and resolve issues in the code.
