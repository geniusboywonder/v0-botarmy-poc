# Implementation Plan: Simple Calculator App

## Objectives and Requirements:
- Develop a simple calculator app with basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Use React for the frontend interface
- Use Express for the backend server to handle calculations
- Ensure the app is responsive and user-friendly

## Technical Specifications:
- Frontend: React
- Backend: Express
- Database: Not required
- Additional Libraries: None required
- Deployment: Can be deployed on any server that supports Node.js

## Implementation Details:
1. Frontend Development:
- Create React app using `create-react-app`
- Design a simple UI with buttons for numbers, operators, and result display
- Implement logic to handle user input and display results

2. Backend Development:
- Set up an Express server with routes for handling arithmetic operations
- Create endpoints for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Implement logic to perform calculations based on user input

3. Integration:
- Connect the frontend and backend by making API calls from React components to Express endpoints
- Test the integration to ensure proper communication and data flow between frontend and backend

4. Testing:
- Perform unit testing for frontend and backend components
- Conduct integration testing to ensure the app functions as expected
- Test for edge cases and error handling scenarios

5. Deployment:
- Deploy the app on a server that supports Node.js
- Ensure proper configuration and setup for production environment
- Monitor performance and address any issues that arise post-deployment

## Dependencies and Assumptions:
- Assumption: Users will input valid numbers and operators
- Dependency: Node.js must be installed on the development and deployment environments
- Assumption: The app will be deployed on a server that supports Node.js and Express

By following this implementation plan, we aim to create a simple calculator app that meets the requirements and provides a seamless user experience.
