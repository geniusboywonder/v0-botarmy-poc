# Implementation Plan: debug

## Objectives and Requirements:
- The objective of this project is to enhance the debugging capabilities of our software by implementing new features and improving existing functionalities.
- The requirements include:
  - Ability to set breakpoints in the code
  - Step through code line by line
  - View variable values during runtime
  - Provide detailed error messages and stack traces

## Technical Specifications:
- Programming Language: Java
- IDE: Intellij IDEA
- Version Control: Git
- Frameworks: JUnit for testing

## Implementation Details:
1. **Breakpoints:**
   - Implement a feature to set breakpoints in the code using the IDE.
   - Allow users to pause the execution of the program at specific lines of code.

2. **Step-through Code:**
   - Develop a functionality to step through the code line by line.
   - Allow users to control the flow of the program during debugging.

3. **Variable Inspection:**
   - Implement a feature to view variable values during runtime.
   - Display the current state of variables in a separate window for easy inspection.

4. **Error Messages and Stack Traces:**
   - Improve the quality of error messages to provide more detailed information about the issue.
   - Display stack traces to help users identify the root cause of the error.

## Dependencies and Assumptions:
- **Dependencies:**
  - Availability of developers for code reviews and testing.
  - Access to the code repository for version control.
  
- **Assumptions:**
  - Developers are familiar with the IDE and its debugging tools.
  - The codebase is well-structured and follows best practices for debugging.

## Timeline:
- Week 1: Implement breakpoints feature
- Week 2: Develop step-through code functionality
- Week 3: Integrate variable inspection feature
- Week 4: Improve error messages and stack traces

## Budget:
- The project budget includes developer hours for implementation, testing, and code reviews.

## Risks:
- Possible risks include delays in development due to unforeseen technical challenges or resource constraints.

By following this implementation plan, we aim to enhance the debugging capabilities of our software and improve the overall development process.
