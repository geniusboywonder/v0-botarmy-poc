# Requirements Analysis: Simple Calculator App

## Objectives and Requirements:
- Objective: To create a simple calculator app with basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- User Requirements:
  - User should be able to input numbers and perform operations using the calculator.
  - User should see the result of the operation displayed on the screen.
  - User should be able to clear the input and start a new calculation.

## Technical Specifications:
- Frontend: React
  - Use React components to create user interface elements such as buttons and input fields.
  - Implement logic to handle user input and perform calculations.
- Backend: Express
  - Setup Express server to handle API requests from the frontend.
  - Implement endpoints for handling arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- Database: None required for this simple calculator app.
- Deployment: Host the frontend and backend on a server to make the app accessible online.

## Implementation Details:
- Frontend:
  - Create components for buttons, input field, and result display.
  - Implement functions to handle user input and perform calculations.
  - Use state management to update the display with the result.
- Backend:
  - Setup Express server with routes for handling API requests.
  - Implement functions to perform arithmetic operations based on the request parameters.
  - Return the result to the frontend for display.

## Dependencies and Assumptions:
- Dependencies:
  - React and React-DOM for frontend development.
  - Express for backend server setup.
  - Axios or Fetch API for making API requests between frontend and backend.
- Assumptions:
  - The calculator app will only support basic arithmetic operations.
  - Input validation will be done on the frontend to ensure correct user input.
  - The app will be deployed on a server accessible via a URL.

By following the requirements analysis outlined above, the development team can ensure a successful implementation of the simple calculator app with React frontend and Express backend.
