# Deployment Plan: Simple Calculator App

## Objectives and Requirements:
The objective of this deployment plan is to successfully launch a simple calculator app with a React frontend and Express backend. The app should allow users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The requirements include a responsive UI, secure data handling, and efficient performance.

## Technical Specifications:
- Frontend Framework: React
- Backend Framework: Express
- Database: Not required for this project
- Hosting Platform: AWS or Heroku
- Version Control: Git

## Implementation Details:
1. Frontend Setup:
- Create a new React app using `create-react-app`.
- Develop the UI components for the calculator app.
- Implement the logic for arithmetic operations in React components.
- Test the frontend functionality locally.

2. Backend Setup:
- Initialize a new Node.js project with Express.
- Set up routes for handling frontend requests.
- Create controllers for performing arithmetic operations.
- Test the backend API endpoints using Postman.

3. Integration:
- Connect the frontend and backend by making API calls from React components.
- Ensure data is passed securely between the frontend and backend.
- Test the full functionality of the calculator app.

4. Deployment:
- Deploy the frontend React app to a hosting platform such as AWS S3 or Heroku.
- Deploy the Express backend to a server on AWS EC2 or Heroku.
- Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments.
- Monitor the app's performance and make any necessary optimizations.

## Dependencies and Assumptions:
- Assumption: The project will be developed using modern development practices and tools.
- Dependency: Stable internet connection for deployment.
- Assumption: The app will not require a database for this simple calculator functionality.
- Dependency: Adequate testing to ensure the app functions as expected.

By following this deployment plan, we aim to successfully launch the simple calculator app with a React frontend and Express backend, meeting all objectives and requirements.
