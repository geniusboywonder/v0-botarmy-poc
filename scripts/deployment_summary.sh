echo "   chmod +x scripts/rebuild_venv.sh"
echo "   ./scripts/rebuild_venv.sh"
echo ""
echo "2. GITHUB DEPLOYMENT SETUP:"
echo "   - Set up Vercel project from GitHub repo"
echo "   - Add GitHub secrets (VERCEL_TOKEN, VERCEL_ORG_ID, VERCEL_PROJECT_ID, GOOGLE_API_KEY)"
echo "   - Push to main branch to trigger deployment"
