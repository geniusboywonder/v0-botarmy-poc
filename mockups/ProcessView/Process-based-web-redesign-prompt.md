Help me restructure my website. The attached screens are the curent layout.
Give me your thoughts based on UI/UX best practise if I:
Change the sidebar (on all screens) to reflect the SDLC process, e.g a page for each stage - Brainstorming, Requriements, Design, Dev, Test, Deploy.
Each page would then have similar elements, namely:
a) An Agent configuration (currently on the Settings page) to upload a role description
b) An Artifact configuration (currently on the Artifact page) to select what artifacts are needed.
c) A Task list (curerntly on the Task page) for all steps needed at this phase (by all agents) and the progress of each step in chronological order
d) Stats on the agent progress, pulled from the Analytics page e.g. total no of tasks, no. of tasks by status (queued, WIP, waiting, done etc)

The process may not be linear or sequential, and we will need indicators in the sidebar on each of the pages that will require user attention.
Likewise the "agent status" on the main page above the chat window should be combined to a process view, with indicators showing which agent is working on each stage, the current task, and any HITL actions required.

I'd like to change the Process Summary View at the top of the Dashboard. It should go across and not down e.g. Requirements -> Desing -> Dev -> Test -> Deploy
Then under each part of the process, show the agent, current task, tasks status, hitl indicator
The pause button for each stage here should allow the HITL to pause/interupt any stage or tasks being performed by the agent.
Also the main way to engage will be via the chat window, so this need to be above the Global stats (maybe even always accessible in the header?) and also above the fold.
The sidebar will have space below the settings to show the system health and potentially the global stats.
Try that and lets see

clear context and background information
the website is to faciitate the process of creating software products with AI agents and covers the entire SDLC from brainstorming through to deployment with key HITL points.

specific role assignment
you are an experienced UI and UX expert,up to date with current web-design trends.

explicit goals and objectives
confirm the redesign of website to optimise the user experience with clear and well structured site that reflects the process and overall objective of the website. update the website to make the user experience is smooth and logical. Once confirmed there will be additional steps to generate mockups.

format preferences tone and style guidance
none

any specific exclusions or limitations
no generation of mockup until the design is agreed.

Use the 2 uploaded ascii screens as a template and mockup the remaining screens to complete the project for the software SDLC.

Brainstorming is NOT included in the process summary pipeline now, its a pre-process extra and cna be removed from the SDLC pipeline

For the process summary on Dashboard: 3-4 lines should be high-level:

Â Line 1 Stage name with status icons (e.g., green check for done, yellow for WIP), plus a quick HITL flag and pause button

Line 2 Agent working on it

Line 3 name of deliverable (cut off if its exceeds the border/boundary of that stage

Line 4 task number / out of total tasks

Include all artifacts on each page that are typical for that stage of the SDLC, so we get a good sense of how this will fit.

The logs page can follow the uploaded screenshots

All screens should be consistently sized and include the sidebar & header.
