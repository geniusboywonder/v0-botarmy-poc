# Frontend Audit Analysis

## 1. WebSocket Service

*   **`EnhancedWebSocketService` (`lib/websocket/websocket-service.ts`):** This is a complex, all-in-one service that manages the WebSocket connection, including reconnect logic, message batching, and heartbeat management. Its size and complexity make it difficult to maintain and test.
*   **State Management:** The service directly interacts with multiple Zustand stores (`useAgentStore`, `useLogStore`, etc.). This tight coupling makes the service less reusable and harder to reason about.

## 2. WebSocket Hooks

*   **`useWebSocket` and `useWebSocketConnection` (`hooks/`):** These hooks provide a layer of abstraction over the `EnhancedWebSocketService`. However, they also contribute to the complexity of the WebSocket implementation.
*   **Redundancy:** There is some overlap in functionality between the two hooks. Their roles could be clarified and potentially consolidated.

## 3. Component Architecture

*   **`SystemHealthDashboard` (`components/system-health-dashboard.tsx`):** This component directly interacts with the `websocketService` to get connection status. This is a good example of a component that is tightly coupled to the WebSocket implementation.
*   **`CopilotChat` (`components/chat/copilot-chat.tsx`):** This component is used in `page.tsx` and likely handles the chat interface. Its interaction with the WebSocket service should be reviewed.

## 4. State Management

*   **Zustand Stores:** The application uses Zustand for state management. The stores are well-organized in the `lib/stores` directory.
*   **Store Interaction:** The way components and services interact with the stores should be reviewed to ensure that state updates are handled consistently and efficiently.

## 5. Entry Points

*   **`app/page.tsx` and `app/layout.tsx`:** These are the main entry points for the application. They set up the main layout and render the initial UI.
