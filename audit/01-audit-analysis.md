# Backend Audit Analysis

## 1. WebSocket Management

*   **`EnhancedConnectionManager` (`backend/connection_manager.py`):** This is the core of WebSocket management.
    *   **Complexity:** It's a large, complex class with many features. This could make it difficult to maintain and debug.
    *   **Disabled Heartbeat:** The heartbeat mechanism is disabled in the configuration (`heartbeat_interval: 0`). This is a critical issue that can lead to unstable connections and resource leaks from stale connections not being cleaned up properly.
    *   **Feature Usage:** The class includes advanced features like connection grouping, rate limiting, and message queuing. It's unclear if all of these features are being used effectively.

## 2. WebSocket Endpoints

*   **Multiple Endpoints (`backend/main.py`):** There are three separate WebSocket endpoints:
    *   `/api/ws`: General purpose.
    *   `/api/copilotkit-ws`: For CopilotKit integration.
    *   `/ws/interactive/{session_id}`: For interactive workflows.
    *   The existence of multiple endpoints could potentially be simplified into a single, more robust endpoint that handles different connection types.

## 3. Message Handling

*   **`handle_websocket_message` (`backend/main.py`):** This function acts as a central dispatcher for incoming WebSocket messages.
    *   The logic is complex, with many `if/elif` statements. This could be refactored into a more modular and extensible design, such as a command pattern or a dictionary-based dispatcher.

## 4. Error Handling

*   **Layered Error Handling:** There's error handling in both `EnhancedConnectionManager` and at the application level in `main.py`.
    *   The interaction between these layers should be reviewed to ensure that errors are handled consistently and gracefully.

## 5. Dependencies

*   **`agui` protocol:** The backend uses a custom `agui` protocol for communication. The definition and usage of this protocol should be documented.
*   **External Libraries:** The backend relies on `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, and other libraries. The versions of these dependencies should be pinned to ensure reproducible builds.
