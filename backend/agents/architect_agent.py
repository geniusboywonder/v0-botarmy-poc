You are a master AI software architect. Your goal is to take a requirements
document and produce a high-level technical architecture specification.

The specification should include:
1. **Technology Stack:** A list of recommended technologies (e.g., Frontend Framework, Backend Language, Database).
2. **System Components:** A breakdown of the major components of the system (e.g., API Server, Database, Caching Layer, Frontend App).
3. **Data Model:** A simple representation of the core data entities and their relationships.
4. **API Endpoints:** A list of key API endpoints, including the HTTP method, path, and a brief description.
5. **Security Considerations:** Basic security requirements

Produce the output in Markdown format. Be concise and clear.

## System Overview
‚ö†Ô∏è **Safety Limit Active**: This agent has reached its maximum LLM call limit ({MAX_LLM_CALLS} calls) to prevent infinite loops.

## Recommended Architecture
Based on requirements: "{requirements_document[:150]}..."

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React/Next.js with TypeScript
- **Backend:** Python FastAPI with async support
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for structured data
- **Caching:** Redis for session management
- **Deployment:** Railway + Replit for development

### System Components
1. **Frontend Application** - User interface and client-side logic
2. **REST API Server** - Business logic and data processing
3. **Database Layer** - Data persistence and queries
4. **Authentication Service** - User management and security
5. **WebSocket Service** - Real-time communication

### Data Model
- Core entities based on requirements analysis
- Relational structure with proper normalization
- API-first design for frontend integration

### Key API Endpoints
- GET/POST /api/auth/* - Authentication endpoints
- GET/POST /api/data/* - Core data operations
- WebSocket /ws - Real-time communication

### Security Considerations
- Input validation and sanitization
- Authentication and authorization
- CORS configuration for frontend
- Rate limiting for API protection

## Status
‚úÖ Enhanced fallback architecture provided
üîÑ Ready to hand off to Developer Agent

Based on requirements: "{requirements_document[:100]}..."

### Recommended Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React/Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Python FastAPI with async support
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for relational data
- **Real-time:** WebSockets for live updates
- **Deployment:** Railway + Replit development environment

### System Components
1. **Frontend Application** - Modern React-based UI
2. **REST API Server** - FastAPI backend service
3. **Database Layer** - PostgreSQL with proper indexing
4. **Authentication Service** - JWT-based user management
5. **WebSocket Handler** - Real-time communication layer

### Core Data Entities
- User management and profiles
- Application-specific data models
- Audit trails and logging
- Configuration and settings

### Essential API Endpoints
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User authentication
- `GET /api/data/list` - Data retrieval
- `POST /api/data/create` - Data creation
- `WebSocket /ws` - Real-time updates

### Security & Performance
- Input validation with Pydantic models
- Rate limiting and CORS configuration  
- Database connection pooling
- Error handling and logging

## Next Steps
- Manual architecture review recommended
- Technical team consultation advised
- Consider specific requirements for optimization
