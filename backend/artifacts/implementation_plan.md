## Implementation Plan:

1. **Setting Up the Development Environment:**
   - Install Node.js, MongoDB, and necessary packages
   - Initialize a new React.js project
   - Configure Express.js server

2. **User Management Component:**
   - Implement user registration form with validation
   - Create login and logout functionalities
   - Develop profile management UI

3. **Task Management Component:**
   - Set up RESTful API endpoints for tasks
   - Implement CRUD operations for tasks
   - Add deadline tracking and status monitoring features

4. **Notification Service Integration:**
   - Set up scheduled tasks for sending reminders
   - Integrate notification service with task management
   - Test notification functionality

## Key Components:
1. **User Management Module:**
   - Responsible for user authentication and account management
   - Handles user registration, login, logout, and profile management

2. **Task Management Module:**
   - Manages task creation, editing, completion tracking, and status monitoring
   - Includes functionalities for task creation, editing, marking as completed, and deadline tracking

## Code Examples:
```javascript
// Example API endpoint for creating a new user account
app.post('/api/users', (req, res) => {
  // Validate user input
  // Create a new user in the database
  // Send success response
});
```

## Development Notes:
- Ensure data encryption for user information
- Implement secure authentication methods
- Enforce authorization to protect user data

By following this Implementation Plan, we will systematically develop the task management web application with a strong focus on user management, task management, and notification service integration. Each component will be carefully implemented following best practices and standards to ensure a secure and efficient system.
