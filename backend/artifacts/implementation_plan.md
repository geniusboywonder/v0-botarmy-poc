# Implementation Plan

## Step-by-Step Development Approach:

1. **Frontend Development** (React.js)
   - Set up the React project structure and dependencies.
   - Create UI components for user input, calculations display, and history.
   - Implement API calls to interact with the backend for calculation requests and history retrieval.
   - Style the frontend application for a visually appealing interface.

2. **Backend Development** (Node.js)
   - Initialize the Node.js project and install necessary packages.
   - Set up Express.js for handling API routes and requests.
   - Implement endpoints for calculation, history retrieval, and deletion.
   - Connect the backend to the SQLite database for data storage and retrieval.

3. **Database Setup** (SQLite)
   - Create the necessary tables and schema for storing user sessions and calculation history.
   - Implement database queries for data manipulation and retrieval.
   - Ensure data integrity and consistency within the database.

4. **Integration and Testing**
   - Integrate the frontend and backend components to ensure seamless communication.
   - Conduct unit tests for API endpoints functionality and database operations.
   - Perform end-to-end testing to validate the application flow and user interactions.

5. **Deployment and Monitoring**
   - Deploy the application on a suitable hosting platform.
   - Set up monitoring tools to track application performance and user interactions.
   - Monitor security measures and ensure data protection throughout the application.

## Key Components and Responsibilities:

- **Frontend App:** Responsible for user interaction and displaying calculation results.
- **API Server:** Handles calculation logic and data processing, interacts with the frontend.
- **Database:** Stores user sessions and calculation history data.

## Code Examples:

### Frontend API Call (React.js):
```javascript
const calculate = async (input) => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/calculate', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ input })
  });
  const data = await response.json();
  return data.result;
};
```

### Backend Calculation Endpoint (Node.js):
```javascript
app.post('/api/calculate', (req, res) => {
  const { input } = req.body;
  const result = performCalculation(input);
  res.json({ result });
});
```

## Development Notes:

- **Security:** Implement HTTPS, input validation, encryption, and secure session management.
- **Scalability:** Design the application to handle increased user load and data storage requirements.
- **Performance:** Optimize API endpoints and database queries for fast and efficient data processing.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling mechanisms to ensure application stability.
- **Documentation:** Maintain clear and concise documentation for codebase and API endpoints for future reference.

By following this implementation plan, we can develop a reliable and efficient calculator application that meets the project requirements and ensures a seamless user experience.
