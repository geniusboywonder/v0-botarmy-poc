# Implementation Plan: Simple Calculator App

## Project Objectives and Requirements:
- Develop a simple calculator app that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- The app should have a user-friendly interface with input fields for numbers and buttons for operations.
- Ensure accurate calculation results and error handling for invalid inputs.
- Support for both iOS and Android platforms.

## Technical Specifications:
- Programming Language: Java for Android and Swift for iOS.
- Development Environment: Android Studio for Android and Xcode for iOS.
- User Interface: Use XML layout for Android and Storyboard for iOS.
- Calculation Logic: Implement algorithms for each arithmetic operation.
- Error Handling: Validate user inputs and display error messages for invalid inputs.
- Testing: Unit testing for calculation logic and UI testing for user interactions.
- Deployment: Publish the app on Google Play Store and Apple App Store.

## Implementation Details:
1. Set up development environments for Android and iOS platforms.
2. Design the user interface with input fields and operation buttons.
3. Implement the calculation logic for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
4. Add error handling to validate user inputs and display error messages.
5. Conduct unit testing to ensure accurate calculation results.
6. Test the app on emulators and physical devices for both platforms.
7. Fix any bugs or issues identified during testing.
8. Publish the app on Google Play Store and Apple App Store.

## Dependencies and Assumptions:
- Dependency: Availability of development tools and resources for Android and iOS platforms.
- Assumption: Users will have a basic understanding of arithmetic operations.
- Assumption: The app will be used for simple calculations and not for complex mathematical operations.
- Assumption: The app will be developed within the specified timeline and budget.

By following this implementation plan, we aim to create a simple calculator app that meets the project objectives and requirements while ensuring a smooth development process and successful deployment on both Android and iOS platforms.
