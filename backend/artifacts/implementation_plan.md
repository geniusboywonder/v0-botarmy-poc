# Implementation Plan: Test Message

## Objectives and Requirements
The objective of this project is to implement a test message feature that allows users to send test messages to each other within the application. The requirements for this feature include:
- User interface for composing and sending test messages
- Backend functionality to handle sending and receiving test messages
- Database storage for test messages
- Notification system for new test messages

## Technical Specifications
- Frontend: The user interface will be developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It will include a form for composing test messages and a display area for viewing received test messages.
- Backend: The backend will be built using Node.js with Express.js for handling HTTP requests. It will include routes for sending and receiving test messages, as well as interacting with the database.
- Database: MongoDB will be used to store test messages. The database schema will include fields for message content, sender, receiver, and timestamp.
- Notifications: A notification system will be implemented using WebSocket technology to notify users of new test messages in real-time.

## Implementation Details
1. Frontend Development:
   - Create the UI components for composing and displaying test messages.
   - Implement form validation for message composition.
2. Backend Development:
   - Set up the Node.js server with Express.js.
   - Create routes for sending and receiving test messages.
   - Connect to the MongoDB database to store and retrieve messages.
3. Database Integration:
   - Design the database schema for storing test messages.
   - Implement CRUD operations for interacting with the database.
4. Notification System:
   - Implement WebSocket connections for real-time notifications.
   - Send notifications to users when they receive a new test message.

## Dependencies and Assumptions
- Dependencies:
   - Node.js and Express.js for backend development.
   - MongoDB for database storage.
   - WebSocket technology for real-time notifications.
- Assumptions:
   - Users have an internet connection to send and receive test messages.
   - The application is already set up with user authentication for sending messages between users.

By following this implementation plan, we will successfully implement the test message feature in the application.
