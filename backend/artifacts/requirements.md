# Requirements Document

## Executive Summary
The project involves building a simple calculator app that will allow users to perform basic mathematical operations. The app will provide a user-friendly interface for users to input their calculations and view the results.

## User Stories
1. As a user, I want to be able to add numbers together so that I can quickly calculate sums.
2. As a user, I want to be able to subtract numbers so that I can easily find the difference between values.
3. As a user, I want to be able to multiply numbers so that I can calculate products efficiently.
4. As a user, I want to be able to divide numbers so that I can perform division calculations accurately.
5. As a user, I want to be able to clear the input field so that I can start a new calculation easily.

## Functional Requirements
1. The app shall have buttons for each numerical digit (0-9) for user input.
2. The app shall have buttons for basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
3. The app shall display the input expression and the result in a clear and readable format.
4. The app shall be able to perform calculations accurately and display the correct result.
5. The app shall have a clear button to reset the input field for a new calculation.

## Non-Functional Requirements
1. Performance: The app shall perform calculations quickly and respond to user input without delays.
2. Usability: The app shall have an intuitive and user-friendly interface for easy navigation and input.
3. Security: The app shall not store or transmit any user data to ensure user privacy and data security.
4. Scalability: The app shall be able to handle multiple user sessions simultaneously without performance degradation.

Overall, the calculator app should provide a simple yet effective tool for users to perform basic mathematical calculations with ease and accuracy.
