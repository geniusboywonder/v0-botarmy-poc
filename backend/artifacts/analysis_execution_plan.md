# Analysis Execution Plan

## Phase Overview:
The objective of this analysis is to gather requirements for the development of a simple task management web application with user authentication, task creation, editing, and completion tracking. The deliverables will include a detailed requirements document outlining user stories, functional requirements, and non-functional requirements.

## Step-by-Step Process:
1. Conduct stakeholder interviews to understand user needs and expectations.
2. Analyze the business goals and objectives of the task management web application.
3. Identify any technical constraints that need to be considered during development.
4. Use brainstorming sessions and workshops to gather requirements collaboratively.
5. Document all requirements in a structured format for clarity and consistency.

## Key Focus Areas:
1. **User Needs:** Understand the requirements of different user types (admins, regular users) and their interactions with the application.
2. **Business Goals:** Ensure that the application aligns with the organization's objectives for improving task management efficiency.
3. **Constraints:** Consider technical limitations such as budget, timeline, and available resources that may impact the development process.

## Success Criteria:
1. Completion of stakeholder interviews and documentation of user needs.
2. Clear alignment between the application features and the identified business goals.
3. Identification of all technical constraints and their impact on the development process.
4. Approval of the requirements document by key stakeholders.

By following this structured analysis plan, we aim to gather comprehensive and clear requirements for the successful development of the task management web application.
