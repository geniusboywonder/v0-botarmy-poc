# System Design Document

## Objectives and Requirements
The objective of this project is to build a simple todo app using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. The app should allow users to create, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. Users should also be able to view their tasks in a list format.

## Technical Specifications
- Frontend: React
- Backend: Node.js
- Database: MongoDB
- API: RESTful API for CRUD operations on tasks
- Authentication: JWT for user authentication

## Implementation Details
### Frontend
The frontend will be built using React to create a user-friendly interface for the todo app. The app will have components for displaying tasks, adding new tasks, editing tasks, and marking tasks as completed. The frontend will make API calls to the backend to fetch and update task data.

### Backend
The backend will be built using Node.js to handle API requests from the frontend. It will utilize Express.js to create a RESTful API for CRUD operations on tasks. The backend will also handle user authentication using JWT tokens to ensure secure access to task data.

### Database
The app will store task data in a MongoDB database. Each task will have fields for title, description, status (completed or not), and user ID to associate tasks with specific users. The database will be queried by the backend to retrieve and update task data.

### Authentication
User authentication will be implemented using JWT tokens. When a user logs in, they will receive a token that will be used to authenticate API requests. This will ensure that only authenticated users can view and modify their tasks.

## Dependencies and Assumptions
- Dependencies:
  - React
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - MongoDB
  - JWT
- Assumptions:
  - Users will need to sign up and log in to access the app
  - Tasks will be associated with specific users based on their user ID

By following this system design, we will be able to build a simple todo app with React and Node.js that meets the objectives and requirements outlined in the project brief.
