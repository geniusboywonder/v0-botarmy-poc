# System Design: Simple Calculator App

## Objectives and Requirements
The objective of this project is to develop a simple calculator app that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The app should have a user-friendly interface with numeric keypad and operation buttons. It should also be able to display the result of the operations in real-time.

## Technical Specifications
- Language: The app will be developed using Java programming language.
- Platform: The app will be developed for Android mobile devices.
- User Interface: The app will have a simple and intuitive user interface with numeric keypad and operation buttons.
- Calculation Engine: The app will have a calculation engine to perform arithmetic operations based on user input.
- Real-time Display: The app will display the result of the operations in real-time as the user inputs the numbers and operations.

## Implementation Details
- User Interface: The user interface will consist of numeric keypad buttons (0-9), operation buttons (+, -, *, /), and a display screen to show the input and result.
- Calculation Engine: The calculation engine will parse the user input and perform the arithmetic operations accordingly. It will handle error checking for invalid input and division by zero.
- Real-time Display: The display screen will update in real-time as the user inputs numbers and operations. The result will be displayed as soon as the user presses the equal button.

## Dependencies and Assumptions
- Dependencies: The app will depend on the Android SDK for development and testing. It will also depend on the Java programming language for coding the logic.
- Assumptions: The app assumes that the user will input valid numbers and operations. It also assumes that the Android device will have a stable internet connection for downloading and updating the app.

Overall, the simple calculator app will provide a basic yet functional tool for users to perform arithmetic calculations on their Android devices. The app will be developed following industry standards and best practices to ensure a smooth user experience.
