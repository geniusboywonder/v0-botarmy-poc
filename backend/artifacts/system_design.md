# Simple Calculator App System Design

## Objectives and Requirements:
- Develop a simple calculator app that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- The app should have a user-friendly interface with buttons for numbers and operators.
- The calculator should be able to display the result of the operation in real-time as the user inputs numbers and operators.
- The app should be responsive and work on both mobile and desktop devices.

## Technical Specifications:
- The app will be developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end.
- The backend will be built using Node.js for handling calculations and logic.
- The app will use a RESTful API to communicate between the frontend and backend.
- Data will be stored locally on the user's device using local storage for quick access.

## Implementation Details:
1. Frontend:
   - Develop the user interface using HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing and intuitive design.
   - Use JavaScript to handle user interactions and update the display with real-time calculations.
   - Implement event listeners on buttons for numbers and operators to trigger the corresponding actions.

2. Backend:
   - Create a Node.js server to handle calculations and logic.
   - Implement API endpoints for performing arithmetic operations.
   - Use Express.js to handle routing and request/response handling.

3. Data Storage:
   - Utilize local storage to store user input and results for quick access.
   - Implement a data management system to handle data storage and retrieval efficiently.

## Dependencies and Assumptions:
- Dependencies:
  - Node.js for backend development
  - Express.js for server-side routing
  - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end development

- Assumptions:
  - Users will have a basic understanding of arithmetic operations.
  - The app will be used for simple calculations and not complex mathematical functions.

By following this system design, we aim to create a simple calculator app that meets the requirements and objectives outlined in the project brief.
