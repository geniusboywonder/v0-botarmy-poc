# Architecture Document

## Technology Stack:
- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB

## System Components:
1. **User Management:**
   - Responsible for user authentication and account management.
   - Includes functionalities for user registration, login, logout, and profile management.
2. **Task Management:**
   - Handles task creation, editing, completion tracking, and status monitoring.
   - Features include task creation, editing, marking as completed, and deadline tracking.
3. **Notification Service:**
   - Sends notifications to users for upcoming task deadlines.
   - Integrates with task management to provide timely reminders.

## Data Model:
1. **User Entity:**
   - Attributes: id (unique identifier), username, password.
   - Relationships: N/A.
2. **Task Entity:**
   - Attributes: id (unique identifier), title, description, deadline, status.
   - Relationships: N/A.

## API Endpoints:
1. **User Management:**
   - **GET /api/users:** Retrieve user information.
   - **POST /api/users:** Create a new user account.
   - **PUT /api/users:** Update user account details.
   - **DELETE /api/users:** Delete user account.
2. **Task Management:**
   - **GET /api/tasks:** Retrieve all tasks.
   - **POST /api/tasks:** Create a new task.
   - **PUT /api/tasks:** Update task details.
   - **DELETE /api/tasks:** Delete a task.

## Security Considerations:
- **User Data Encryption:** Implement encryption mechanisms to secure user data.
- **Secure Authentication Protocols:** Use secure authentication methods to protect user accounts.
- **Authorization:** Ensure users can only access and modify their own data.

By following this architecture design, we aim to create a robust and user-friendly task management web application that meets the requirements of both admin and regular users. The selected technologies and components are chosen to provide a secure, scalable, and efficient system that enhances productivity and task management processes.
