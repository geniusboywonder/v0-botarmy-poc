### Test Plan

#### Testing Strategy:
The testing strategy will encompass both manual and automated testing to ensure thorough validation of the task management web application. Manual testing will focus on user interface validation, while automated testing will cover backend functionalities. Test coverage will include functional, integration, system, and security testing to address all aspects of the application.

#### Test Cases:
1. **User Management Module:**
   - Test user registration with valid and invalid inputs to verify validation rules
   - Validate login and logout functionalities to ensure smooth user authentication
   - Verify profile management features by updating user information and checking for consistency

2. **Task Management Module:**
   - Test CRUD operations for tasks to confirm create, read, update, and delete functionalities work correctly
   - Validate deadline tracking by setting deadlines for tasks and ensuring accurate tracking
   - Verify status monitoring features by updating task status and checking for proper updates

#### Test Data:
- **User Management Module:**
   - Sample user data for registration testing with variations in input fields
- **Task Management Module:**
   - Test tasks with different deadlines and statuses to cover various scenarios

#### Quality Metrics:
- **Success Criteria:** All test cases pass without any critical defects impacting core functionalities
- **Measurement Approaches:** Track and monitor the number of passed/failed test cases, prioritize defect resolution to maintain testing progress

By following the comprehensive test plan outlined above, we aim to validate the task management web application thoroughly across all modules and functionalities. The focus on both manual and automated testing, along with varied test scenarios and quality metrics, will ensure a high-quality and reliable product is delivered to meet user requirements and expectations.
