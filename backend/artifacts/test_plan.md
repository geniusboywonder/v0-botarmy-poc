# Test Plan for Simple Todo App with React and Node.js

## Objective:
The objective of this test plan is to ensure the functionality, performance, and usability of the simple todo app built using React and Node.js. The app should allow users to create, update, and delete tasks in a simple and intuitive manner.

## Requirements:
1. Users should be able to create a new task with a title and description.
2. Users should be able to mark a task as completed and vice versa.
3. Users should be able to delete a task.
4. Tasks should be displayed in a list format with options to edit and delete.
5. The app should have proper error handling and validation for input fields.

## Technical Specifications:
- Frontend: React
- Backend: Node.js
- Database: MongoDB (or any other preferred database)
- API: RESTful API for CRUD operations

## Implementation Details:
1. Test the creation of a new task:
   - Verify that users can add a new task with a title and description.
   - Ensure that the task is displayed in the list of tasks.

2. Test updating a task:
   - Verify that users can mark a task as completed.
   - Verify that users can update the title or description of a task.

3. Test deleting a task:
   - Ensure that users can delete a task from the list.
   - Verify that the task is removed from the database.

4. Test error handling:
   - Test for proper validation of input fields.
   - Verify that users receive appropriate error messages for invalid inputs.

5. Test performance:
   - Test the app with a large number of tasks to ensure it can handle the load efficiently.
   - Check for any performance issues such as slow loading times or laggy behavior.

## Dependencies and Assumptions:
1. Assumes that the frontend and backend are properly connected and communicating through API calls.
2. Assumes that the database is set up and functioning correctly.
3. Assumes that the app is deployed on a server for testing.

## Conclusion:
This test plan outlines the testing approach for the simple todo app built with React and Node.js. By following this plan, we aim to ensure the app meets the requirements and functions smoothly for users.
