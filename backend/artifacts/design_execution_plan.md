# Design Execution Plan

## Design Overview:
The architecture objective is to develop a simple yet efficient task management web application that meets the user requirements outlined in the executive summary. The approach will focus on creating a secure, scalable, and user-friendly system that enhances productivity.

## Design Methodology:
1. **Requirement Analysis:** Understand user stories, functional, and non-functional requirements.
2. **Technology Selection:** Choose appropriate technologies for frontend, backend, and database.
3. **System Design:** Define system components, data model, and API endpoints.
4. **Quality Assurance:** Establish architecture principles and validation criteria.

## Key Design Areas:
1. **Technology Selection:**
   - Frontend: React.js
   - Backend: Node.js with Express.js
   - Database: MongoDB
2. **System Components:**
   - User Management
   - Task Management
   - Notification Service
3. **Data Modeling:**
   - User (id, username, password)
   - Task (id, title, description, deadline, status)
4. **API Endpoints:**
   - /api/users (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
   - /api/tasks (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
5. **Security Considerations:**
   - User data encryption
   - Secure authentication protocols

## Quality Standards:
1. **Performance:** Ensure system responds to user actions within 2 seconds.
2. **Scalability:** Design system to accommodate increasing users and tasks.
3. **Security:** Implement encryption and secure authentication measures.
4. **Usability:** Focus on user-friendly interface and intuitive task management features.

By following this Design Execution Plan, we aim to deliver a robust task management web application that meets the needs of both admin and regular users, enhancing productivity and efficiency in task management processes.
