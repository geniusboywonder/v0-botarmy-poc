# Requirements Analysis: Simple Calculator App

## Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a simple calculator app that enables users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The app should be user-friendly, intuitive, and provide accurate results.

## Requirements:
1. **User Interface (UI):**
   - The app should have a clean and user-friendly interface with buttons for numbers (0-9) and operations (+, -, *, /).
   - It should display the input numbers and the result of the operation.
   - Users should be able to clear the input and result with a clear button.
  
2. **Functionality:**
   - The app should be able to perform basic arithmetic operations accurately.
   - It should handle decimal numbers and negative numbers.
   - Division by zero should be handled appropriately (e.g., display an error message).
  
3. **Technical Specifications:**
   - The app will be developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - The app should be responsive and work on different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
   - It should follow best practices for code quality, readability, and maintainability.
  
4. **Implementation Details:**
   - The calculator app will consist of HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality.
   - Event listeners will be used to capture user input from button clicks.
   - Functions will be implemented to perform arithmetic operations based on the user input.
  
5. **Dependencies and Assumptions:**
   - The app will not have any external dependencies and will be self-contained.
   - It is assumed that users will have basic knowledge of arithmetic operations and how to use a calculator.
   - The app will not store any user data and will not have any advanced features such as memory functions or history.
  
By following these requirements and technical specifications, we aim to develop a simple calculator app that meets the needs of users looking for a basic tool to perform arithmetic calculations.
