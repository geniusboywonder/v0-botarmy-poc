# Requirements Analysis for Simple Calculator App

## Objectives and Requirements
The main objective of this project is to develop a simple calculator app for basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The app should have a user-friendly interface that allows users to input numbers and perform calculations easily. The requirements for the app include:
1. Ability to perform basic arithmetic operations
2. Clear display of input numbers and results
3. User-friendly interface with buttons for numbers and operations
4. Error handling for invalid inputs
5. Option to clear the input and start a new calculation

## Technical Specifications
- The app will be developed using a mobile app development framework such as React Native or Flutter for cross-platform compatibility.
- The user interface will be designed using modern UI/UX principles to ensure a seamless user experience.
- The app will use basic mathematical algorithms to perform arithmetic operations.
- Data validation will be implemented to handle invalid inputs and prevent calculation errors.
- The app will be tested on various devices and screen sizes to ensure responsiveness.

## Implementation Details
- The app will have separate components for input fields, number buttons, operation buttons, and result display.
- The arithmetic operations will be implemented using functions that take input numbers and the operation type as parameters.
- Error handling will be implemented to display messages for invalid inputs such as dividing by zero or entering non-numeric characters.
- The user interface will be designed with a clean and intuitive layout to make it easy for users to input numbers and perform calculations.

## Dependencies and Assumptions
- The app will require access to basic arithmetic functions and mathematical operations.
- The app will assume that users have basic knowledge of arithmetic operations and how to use a calculator.
- The app will not have advanced features such as scientific calculations or complex mathematical functions.
- The app will depend on the device's operating system and hardware capabilities for performance and compatibility.

Overall, the simple calculator app will provide users with a convenient tool for performing basic arithmetic calculations on their mobile devices. The app will be designed with simplicity and usability in mind to cater to a wide range of users.
