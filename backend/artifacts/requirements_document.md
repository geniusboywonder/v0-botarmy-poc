# Requirements Analysis: Simple Todo App with React and Node.js

## Objectives and Requirements
The objective of this project is to develop a simple todo app using React for the front-end and Node.js for the back-end. The app should allow users to create, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. Additionally, users should be able to filter tasks based on their status (completed, active, all).

Requirements:
- User should be able to create a new task with a title and description.
- User should be able to edit and delete existing tasks.
- User should be able to mark tasks as completed or active.
- User should be able to filter tasks based on their status.

## Technical Specifications
- Front-end: React
  - Use React components to create a user-friendly interface for managing tasks.
  - Implement state management to handle task data and user interactions.
  - Utilize React Router for navigating between different views (task list, task details, etc.).
- Back-end: Node.js
  - Create RESTful APIs to handle CRUD operations for tasks.
  - Use Express.js to set up server routes and handle requests.
  - Implement a simple database (e.g., MongoDB) to store task data.

## Implementation Details
1. Front-end:
   - Create components for task list, task form, task item, and task filter.
   - Implement state management (e.g., useState, useContext) to manage task data.
   - Use Axios or Fetch API to make HTTP requests to the backend server.
2. Back-end:
   - Set up Express server with routes for CRUD operations on tasks.
   - Connect to a database to store and retrieve task data.
   - Implement validation and error handling for incoming requests.

## Dependencies and Assumptions
- Dependencies:
  - React: for building the front-end interface.
  - Node.js: for creating the back-end server.
  - Express.js: for handling server routes and requests.
  - MongoDB: for storing task data.
- Assumptions:
  - Users will access the app through a web browser.
  - The app will not require user authentication for simplicity.
  - The focus is on functionality rather than design aesthetics.

Overall, this requirements analysis outlines the key objectives, technical specifications, implementation details, and dependencies for developing a simple todo app with React and Node.js. By following these guidelines, the project should be able to meet the desired functionality and provide a seamless user experience.
