# Requirements Document

## Executive Summary:
The project aims to develop a simple task management web application that includes user authentication, task creation, editing, and completion tracking. The application will streamline task management processes and enhance user productivity.

## User Stories:
1. As an admin, I want to be able to create and manage user accounts to ensure secure access to the application.
2. As a regular user, I want to create new tasks, edit existing tasks, and mark tasks as completed for efficient task management.
3. As a user, I want to be able to track the status of tasks and receive notifications for upcoming deadlines.

## Functional Requirements:
1. The system shall provide user authentication functionality to secure access to the application.
2. Users shall be able to create new tasks by specifying task details such as title, description, and deadline.
3. Users shall have the ability to edit task details including title, description, and deadline.
4. The application shall allow users to mark tasks as completed and track the status of tasks.
5. Notifications shall be sent to users for upcoming task deadlines.

## Non-Functional Requirements:
1. The system shall have a performance requirement of responding to user actions within 2 seconds.
2. The application shall implement security measures such as encryption of user data and secure authentication protocols.
3. The system shall be scalable to accommodate increasing numbers of users and tasks as the application grows.

By capturing these requirements, the development team can proceed with designing and implementing the task management web application. The user stories, functional requirements, and non-functional requirements outlined in this document will serve as the foundation for the successful delivery of the project.
