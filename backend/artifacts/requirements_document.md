# Requirements Analysis

## Objectives and Requirements
The objective of the project is to create a test message system that allows users to send and receive messages securely. The system should have the following requirements:
- Users should be able to create an account and log in securely.
- Users should be able to send messages to other users.
- Messages should be encrypted to ensure privacy and security.
- Users should be able to view their message history.
- The system should have a user-friendly interface.

## Technical Specifications
The test message system will be built using the following technologies:
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: MongoDB
- Encryption: AES encryption algorithm
- Authentication: JWT tokens

## Implementation Details
1. User Registration: Users will be able to create an account by providing their email address and password. The system will hash and salt the password before storing it in the database.
2. User Authentication: Users will log in by providing their email and password. Upon successful authentication, the system will generate a JWT token for the user.
3. Message Sending: Users will be able to send messages to other users by providing the recipient's email address and message content. The system will encrypt the message using AES before storing it in the database.
4. Message Viewing: Users will be able to view their message history, including sent and received messages.
5. User Interface: The system will have a clean and intuitive user interface that allows users to easily navigate and use the messaging features.

## Dependencies and Assumptions
- Dependencies: The project will rely on external libraries for encryption and authentication. These libraries will need to be properly integrated into the system.
- Assumptions: It is assumed that users will have a basic understanding of how to use a messaging system and will follow best practices for creating secure passwords.

Overall, the test message system aims to provide a secure and user-friendly messaging platform for users to communicate with each other.
