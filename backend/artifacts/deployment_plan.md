# Deployment Plan

## Deployment Strategy:
The recommended deployment approach for the calculator application is to use a containerized solution such as Docker. By containerizing the application, we can ensure consistency in deployment across different environments and easily scale the application as needed. The deployment process will involve building Docker images for the frontend, backend, and database components, and orchestrating them using a container management tool like Kubernetes.

## Infrastructure:
For server and hosting requirements, we recommend using a cloud service provider such as AWS or Google Cloud Platform. The infrastructure should include separate servers for the frontend, backend, and database components to ensure isolation and improved performance. Additionally, the servers should have sufficient resources to handle the expected user load and storage requirements of the application.

## CI/CD Pipeline:
To automate the deployment process, we will set up a CI/CD pipeline using tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI/CD. The pipeline will include steps for building, testing, and deploying the application to the production environment. Automated testing will be integrated into the pipeline to ensure that any changes made to the codebase do not introduce regressions or vulnerabilities.

## Monitoring:
For health checks and monitoring setup, we recommend using monitoring tools such as Prometheus and Grafana. These tools will provide real-time visibility into the performance and availability of the application, including metrics on response times, error rates, and resource utilization. Additionally, we will set up alerts to notify the team of any critical issues or failures in the system.

By following this deployment plan, we aim to streamline the deployment process, improve the reliability of the application, and ensure that it meets the quality metrics defined in the testing strategy. The use of containerization, cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and monitoring tools will help us achieve our goals of delivering a robust and scalable calculator application to our users.
