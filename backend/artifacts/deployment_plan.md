# Deployment Plan for Simple Todo App with React and Node.js

## Objectives and Requirements:
- The objective is to deploy a simple todo app built with React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend.
- The app should allow users to create, update, and delete tasks in a todo list.
- The deployment should be scalable, secure, and easily maintainable.

## Technical Specifications:
- Frontend: React
- Backend: Node.js
- Database: MongoDB
- Hosting: AWS EC2 for backend, AWS S3 for frontend

## Implementation Details:
1. **Set up AWS EC2 instance for Node.js backend**:
   - Install Node.js and MongoDB on the EC2 instance.
   - Clone the backend code repository and install dependencies.
   - Configure the environment variables for the database connection.

2. **Set up AWS S3 bucket for React frontend**:
   - Build the React frontend using npm build.
   - Upload the build files to the S3 bucket.
   - Configure the bucket for static website hosting.

3. **Configure security settings**:
   - Set up security groups on AWS to allow traffic only on necessary ports.
   - Implement SSL/TLS certificates for secure communication.

4. **Set up continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD)**:
   - Use a CI/CD tool like Jenkins or GitHub Actions to automate the deployment process.
   - Configure the CI/CD pipeline to build and deploy changes to the production environment.

5. **Monitoring and logging**:
   - Set up monitoring tools like CloudWatch to monitor the health and performance of the deployed app.
   - Configure logging to track errors and debug issues.

## Dependencies and Assumptions:
- **Dependencies**:
   - Stable internet connection for deployment.
   - Access to AWS services for hosting and deployment.
   - Proper configuration of environment variables for database connection.

- **Assumptions**:
   - The development of the app is complete and ready for deployment.
   - The deployment environment meets the technical specifications required for React and Node.js.

By following this deployment plan, we aim to successfully deploy the simple todo app with React and Node.js, meeting all objectives and requirements.
