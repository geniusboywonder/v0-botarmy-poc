# Deployment Plan: Simple Calculator App

## Objectives and Requirements:
- Develop a user-friendly simple calculator app that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Ensure the app is compatible with both iOS and Android platforms.
- Implement a clean and intuitive user interface for easy navigation and input.
- Include error handling to prevent crashes or incorrect calculations.
- Deploy the app to the Google Play Store and Apple App Store for public access.

## Technical Specifications:
- Programming Language: Java for Android development, Swift for iOS development.
- Development Tools: Android Studio for Android development, Xcode for iOS development.
- User Interface: Develop a simple and user-friendly UI using XML for Android and SwiftUI for iOS.
- Data Storage: No persistent data storage required for this app.
- Testing: Conduct thorough testing on various devices to ensure compatibility and functionality.
- Deployment: Deploy the app to the Google Play Store and Apple App Store following their respective guidelines and requirements.

## Implementation Details:
1. Develop the core functionality of the calculator app, including the arithmetic operations and error handling.
2. Design and implement the user interface for both Android and iOS platforms.
3. Conduct testing on emulators and physical devices to ensure the app functions correctly.
4. Address any bugs or issues found during testing.
5. Prepare the necessary assets and information for app store deployment.
6. Submit the app to the Google Play Store and Apple App Store for review and approval.
7. Monitor and respond to any feedback or reviews from users post-deployment.

## Dependencies and Assumptions:
- Dependent on the availability and compatibility of development tools and SDKs for Android and iOS platforms.
- Assumption that users will have access to devices running Android 5.0+ and iOS 10.0+ for optimal performance.
- Dependent on the approval process of the Google Play Store and Apple App Store for deployment.
- Assumption that users will have a basic understanding of arithmetic operations for app usage.

By following this deployment plan, we aim to successfully create and deploy a simple calculator app that meets the objectives and requirements outlined above.
