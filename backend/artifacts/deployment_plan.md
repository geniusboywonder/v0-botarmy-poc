# Deployment Plan: test message

## Objectives and Requirements:
- Deploy the test message application to production environment
- Ensure the application is functional and accessible to end-users
- Minimize downtime during deployment process
- Perform thorough testing before and after deployment
- Provide necessary documentation for troubleshooting and maintenance

## Technical Specifications:
- Application: test message
- Environment: Production
- Technologies: Node.js, React, MongoDB
- Deployment Method: Git and CI/CD pipeline
- Servers: AWS EC2 instances
- Monitoring: New Relic for performance monitoring

## Implementation Details:
1. Pre-deployment:
   - Conduct a thorough code review to ensure quality and security
   - Update the production environment with the latest patches and updates
   - Backup the database and application files for rollback in case of issues

2. Deployment Process:
   - Pull the latest code from the Git repository
   - Build the application using npm install and npm run build
   - Update the environment variables for production environment
   - Start the application server
   - Verify application functionality and performance

3. Post-deployment:
   - Perform thorough testing including functional, performance, and security testing
   - Monitor application performance using New Relic
   - Update documentation with any changes made during deployment
   - Notify stakeholders about successful deployment

## Dependencies and Assumptions:
- Dependency: Availability of AWS EC2 instances with required specifications
- Dependency: Proper network connectivity and access permissions to servers
- Assumption: Code changes have been thoroughly tested in lower environments
- Assumption: Deployment team has necessary permissions and access to production environment

By following this deployment plan, we aim to successfully deploy the test message application to production environment with minimal downtime and maximum efficiency.
