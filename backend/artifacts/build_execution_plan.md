# Build Execution Plan

## Development Overview:
The development objective is to implement a secure and efficient task management web application using React.js for the frontend, Node.js with Express.js for the backend, and MongoDB for the database. The scope includes user management, task management, and notification service components.

## Implementation Methodology:
The implementation will follow an Agile methodology with iterative development cycles. Continuous integration and deployment practices will be utilized to ensure code quality and efficiency.

## Development Phases:
1. **Phase 1: Setting Up the Development Environment**
   - Configure development tools and environments
   - Set up project structure and dependencies

2. **Phase 2: User Management Component**
   - Implement user registration, login, logout functionalities
   - Develop profile management features

3. **Phase 3: Task Management Component**
   - Create CRUD operations for tasks
   - Implement deadline tracking and status monitoring

4. **Phase 4: Notification Service Integration**
   - Integrate notification service with task management
   - Send timely reminders for upcoming task deadlines

## Technical Standards:
1. **Code Quality:** Follow best practices for clean and maintainable code
2. **Testing:** Implement unit tests for backend API endpoints and frontend components
3. **Documentation:** Document codebase and API endpoints for future reference

## Implementation Plan:
1. **Setting Up the Development Environment:**
   - Install Node.js, MongoDB, and necessary packages
   - Initialize a new React.js project
   - Configure Express.js server

2. **User Management Component:**
   - Implement user registration form with validation
   - Create login and logout functionalities
   - Develop profile management UI

3. **Task Management Component:**
   - Set up RESTful API endpoints for tasks
   - Implement CRUD operations for tasks
   - Add deadline tracking and status monitoring features

4. **Notification Service Integration:**
   - Set up scheduled tasks for sending reminders
   - Integrate notification service with task management
   - Test notification functionality

## Key Components:
1. **User Management Module:**
   - Responsible for user authentication and account management
   - Handles user registration, login, logout, and profile management

2. **Task Management Module:**
   - Manages task creation, editing, completion tracking, and status monitoring
   - Includes functionalities for task creation, editing, marking as completed, and deadline tracking

## Code Examples:
```javascript
// Example API endpoint for creating a new user account
app.post('/api/users', (req, res) => {
  // Validate user input
  // Create a new user in the database
  // Send success response
});
```

## Development Notes:
- Ensure data encryption for user information
- Implement secure authentication methods
- Enforce authorization to protect user data
